"On 5th February 2025, I bought Samsung S25 Ultra phone. I opened it up at the store and used it, made a video of it too, an app opened on its own, I thought that some setting was not right.

But this automatic app opening is still going on till date. I went to the local Samsung service center after just two days, they said it will get fixed on its own.

From the very first day, Now Brief does not appear on the lock screen.

AI does not work properly every time. I went to the local service center again and again, then they asked me to reset and update the software.

It did not seem right to get this done in a new phone, but there was no other way. I sat there for two days, did everything but the phone worked as it was.

Called Samsung customer care, they checked with the monitor, fixed the apps...the problem persisted.

Some concerned officer Mr. Nikhil Rai talked to me. I ordered so many things, I sent videos of apps opening automatically, sent photos of the lock screen in which Now Brief does not open.

Nikhil talked to me on Thursday, 27 February and said that he will call me on Friday evening between 4 and 5. I waited but no call came.

I called customer care again on Monday and they made me talk to Nikhil...then said that they will talk on Tuesday evening between 4 and 6.

I told them beforehand that I will not get this phone repaired now, now I want a replacement.

I waited again on Tuesday, no call came. Then I called customer care on Wednesday and they made me talk to Nikhil.

Nikhil again talked about doing some logging for which I would have to go to Samsung's service center. I told them that I have already said that I will not do all this now.

I am 68 years old, I am a heart patient, I have kidney problems, I am diabetic, I have blood pressure...it is not possible for me to go to the market again and again. I am alone.

My health has deteriorated due to this mental torture for one month. My cardiologist is worried.

Samsung has caused me financial, mental and physical trouble by giving me a bad phone. And they are making me run from one place to another.

If you are buying any Samsung product then keep in mind that the after sales service of Samsung is very bad.

"S25 (50 MP): 1/1.56‚Äù sensor ‚Üí Larger individual pixels
S25 Ultra (200 MP): 1/1.3‚Äù sensor ‚Üí Much smaller individual pixels

The sensor size increase from S25 to S25 Ultra is 1/1.56"" to 1/1.3""
But the increase in megapixel is 50MP to 200MP !
This is a trick to make it look `better`.

If Samsung had kept pixel sizes the same, the S25 Ultra should have had around 60 MP, not 200 MP.

The 200 MP resolution is over 3√ó higher than the proportional sensor increase, which means each individual pixel is significantly smaller. This forces Samsung to rely heavily on pixel binning to improve low-light performance, rather than just using larger native pixels.

The MP increase is way out of proportion compared to the sensor size increase. üöÄ
Don't fall for that marketing trick.

"Unpopular opinion? I owned S24 Ultra for 1 month only.
That phone hurts my palm so bad. Too wide, too boxy, too heavy. Even read some reviews that it could puncture their jeans. I couldnt endure the discomfort. And I came from most of the Note series so I am familiar with the feel of boxy phones, but s24U is just uncomfortable to use. Even using a case did not solve my problems. Sold it. Bought s25U and the difference is night and day.

S25U is A LOT smoother, faster, and very comfortable to hold. The ""hated"" curved frame is GREAT. The ""hated"" reduced weight is PERFECT. Like i could use this phone for 3-4 yrs. Almost perfect phone if it wasnt for the spen downgrade. But its fine for me. As i wont be using the spen shutter everyday, but id be holding my phone everyday ofcourse.

And the speakers... I owned a Note 20 prior to s24U and my Note 20 sounded a lot better. S24U's speakers sound so flat. I hated it so bad. Whereas the S25U probably has the best phone speaker as of this moment. Really punchy bass and great overall.

And oh, S24U overheats as well. I play games on my phone and even setting the graphics to minimum and low fps, it still overheats so bad. Whereas the S25U does not AT ALL. 

I was just so disappointed with the S24U that I didnt feel the upgrade and I came from only the Note 20 at that.

Maybe you cannot see huge improvements or drastic innovations on the S25U (and same, spen is a let down)... but samsung FIXED the things I HATED with my s24U. Hate is an understatement for such an expensive phone. Those things made me let go of my s24U and try the s25U. 

And I am just so happy with my S25U.:)
Titanium Gray variant is such a lovely color as well.

Hope people would just stop this train hate for the s25U.
It is an AMAZING PHONE. A LOT BETTER THAN S24U.",0.9167,0.179,0.155,0.666

Thanks for this video.  Is there a way to disable the ai features in the Samsung camera app?  I film a lot of cycling content and often times film while I am riding.  I got this new phone for its video qualities and the video sound is terrible with any kind of wind.  If I am riding my bike and talking in to my camera it is almost like my voice will cut in and out and it muffles my voice to the point where you can barely hear it. Almost like I am talking under water or something. It will go to where you can barely hear my voice in the video and then will get super loud.  I did try to fix this with the audio eraser but it doesn't seem fixable.  And I do not want to have to fix every clip after I record it.  I never had this issue with my s21.

"Samsung is a big name in the world of electronics. Samsung mobiles are the best selling. Galaxy S Ultra series is very famous.

 

This year S25 Ultra was launched. I bought it on 5th February 2025. The phone started malfunctioning from the very first day.

 

I went to the local Samsung service center, they postponed the matter. I went there again and again, finally they did a reset and software update.

 

Meanwhile, Samsung's customer care also worked on the phone.

 

For the last one month, I either wait for the phone or go to the service center and sit there.

 

Every time they just postpone it, they will do something tomorrow, they will do it after three days, Samsung has given me nothing but stress for the last one month.

 

I am 68 years old, I am a heart patient, I have kidney problems, I have blood pressure, I am diabetic, I take medicines throughout the day. My doctor advises me to avoid stress.

 

But for the last one month Samsung has brought a lot of stress on me.

 

My cardiologist is worried about my health. If tomorrow there is any effect on my life then Samsung will definitely be responsible.

 

I request with folded hands, never buy anything from Samsung. Once they sell it, these people do not listen to anyone, at any cost.

 

On Monday I will present my case in the consumer court. From tomorrow itself I will make posters in the city and warn customers through microphone - do not buy Samsung. Even Galaxy S25 Ultra turned out to be bad and no one is listening to me.

"I'll be getting the s25 ultra as a upgrade for my s23 ultra since I broke the display and it's mostly because glass screen protectors are annoying on curved displays and with this phone I'll be able to use the glass protectors like I did back when I used my Galaxy Note 3 till 2017 which is definitely more secure than a thin screen foil. That's why I used a iPhone for my business purposes. I could use glass screen protector because the display was flat.

My second reason was that I wanted to fully use my indoor wifi modems like the one hardwired in my Mercedes W201 and at all my houses after upgrading them in January.

Third reason is that my provider added a EU wide 100gb data plan for phones, where I got the S25 Ultra and the contract for ~40$ per month and even though my s23 ultra has 1tb storage and s25 ultra will have 512gb but I will be putting all my movies on my old laptop which I converted into a cloud streaming/storage server",0.3499,0.039,0.02,0.941

Weight loss (168 to 162 grams)
Slightly better battery capacity (3900mAh to 4000 mAh)
Better design to me (flat phone bezel, matte finish)

The S23 was the perfect phone to me so these little improvements made me decide to bring in the S25 and sell my previous device (was not interested in S24 cause the Exynos chip). That way the next owner gets hardly 12 month of official Samsung warranty with my used S23 and if I remember correctly 3 years update of the software.
