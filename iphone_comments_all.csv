"upgrading to this from an XR, very excited"
"Maybe 10 dollars for unlimited access to the app would be fair, a bit on the expensive end though. Imagine paying 50 dollars, now imagine paying 50 a year, thats crazy"
"in March 2025, this video hits even harder then ever. As someone with an iPhone 15 pro max I can say that Apple intelligence is a bad joke. Apple is losing the plot."
I wish the pro models came in fun colours

I'm still using the 13 mini and won't get another iPhone unless the mini comes back. The 6.1 inch screen is way too big and I always drop the big phones with my small hands. Been using iPhone for 10 years but won't get them anymore if the mini doesn't come back.
Thanks for sharing your review! Only a new look only! Staying with my 13!
What a terrible app hahahahah. This world is turning into such a joke.
Just came back after watching a vivo x200 pro and I never thought I would say this but the iPhones camera sucks compared to vivo X200 pro I am a life long iPhone user and yeah iPhone sucks
"iPhone 16 este foarte tare, mă gândesc să-mi cumpăr unul singur"
Can we deactivate the camera control if it really bothers us?
"Unfortunately 16 pro max isn’t up to my expectations, 100% won’t give me 9 hours. Have to charge it twice daily😢"
I started watching this review for an honest opinion on the new iphone. Then I realized MKBHD is going to sell me his stupid overpriced wallpaper app -.-
Which tasks app do you use?
"For a difference of 200 USD, 16 or 16 pro?"
is it really safe to use 45w charger (i have a samsung one)
I'm in EU and i move from 14 to 16 pro and AI isnt there yet but i know 16 is hard number for humanity so will wait to see whats gonna happen in April :)
i think the tv in the back is roasting apple frrr😭
This is Stephon from weekend update! Absolutely awesome😂
"Honestly, truetone is like an eye comfort shield...it's just by night Eyecomfort shield became warmer."
60hz trash.
"apple made a massive changed. iphone 15 is now iphone 16 😂
isheeps are been fooled again!!! 😂"
The King of 60 hz😂😂😂😂
Shouldn’t have bought the iPhone 16. Should have gone with S24.
Apple is insulting us with non 120hz display for this expensive phone
"Apple should go back to releasing ""s"" version of the iphones. it makes more sense releasing major iphone changes every 2 years since yearly upgrades is a thing of the past."
"Very useful video, you should buy this iPhone"
"Using iPhone 16 for the last week. Didn’t find any difference from my earlier Redmi note lite, which is still continuing to work.  Had to get  iPhone to supplement my iPad in which I am using Goodnotes for study set and notes. I am a student i can view notes on iPhone during travel when it is not convenient to take iPad. If you are not studying or using any major apps in iPad which you need to view or refer, you may not need an iPhone."

My sister has the 11 so I think it’s a great upgrade for her
Still no charger and you have to wait hour and 42 minutes to be fully charged. Stupidity beyond belief.
I thought the iphone 16 had a 48 MP camera??
Looks like a budget phone from the back
a lot of monotonic stream of words. who are the people subscribing to this channel?
"😄If going to complain about the 60Hz refresh, should complain long ago about the old IPS which Apple had been using costing more than AMOLED screens. Don't be fooled, 90Hz and 120Hz Android phones often not better than 60Hz iPhone. Because those Android phones often can't run 60fps UI let alone 90fps and 120fps"
We buy iphone every 5-7 years to feel the difference..
0:51 the TV in the back 😂
Sulit na upgrade na po ba from iphone 11 to 16? Or go for 16 pro?
Later is coming my iphone 16 barbie pink📱💖💖

Came here after getting an iphone16 128gb offer from GPlan... oo nga naman why buy the 128Gb one hindi naman mamamaximize yung phone kahit maganda pa ang features. Thanks for the honest review!
Thanks for this review. ❤ I got my iphone 16 from iphone XR
I'm stuck between iPhone 16 or iPhone 15 plus ano po mas maganda?

Ano pong tech gadget were you using filming this vlog? Tha video quality is brilliant!
"Samsung Lets you take Control
While Apple Controls you! Simple as that, Sad but it's the reality"
"As someone who came from a mid range android phone, 16 plus is a total upgrade! Tho i wanted the pro max, I have a budget limitation. But i think i’m already good with what I have."
Ako na naka iphone 6 pa rin huhu
Watching this review again on my ip 11 hahahaha
"From iphone 7plus to 15, kung di pa nagpapalya 7p ko i will not upgrade as long as it is working pa 😅"

Yes if i am spending 800 dollars i would spend another 200 to buy the best of the best. Period
"U lucky your parents bought u 2 phones, kids 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"

"No innovation, anybody buying this just shows how unintelligent of a customer they are"
My aamsung a15 literally cost 200 and has 90 hz when iphone 16 cost 800 and has 60hz 😂
Bro just buy samsung a55 5g 😅
"Thats Pro Max, not Pro"
iPhone 16 looks like Android🤣 why changed the camera..
Literally just a software update
I have the iPhone 16 pro max love already keeping it
Bruh of course iPhone 16 pro better than iPhone 16🗿
Straight to the point! Man i love shorts.
I have the 11 in purple and been wanting the 16 pro in white for a while and I’ve saved up for it so this just convinced me to buy it lol
It's too big for my tiny hands i wish if there is a smaller version
nanood ako para maingit
Masaya ako sa purchase ko after iphone xr. That’s nice and no regret rather than buying flagship Samsung. Quite smooth kahit 60 Hz siya. Well-compensated naman siya ng new apple chip.
Baligtad yta d b iphone ang iyak sa samsung
Mas maganda ang iphone kasi american brand 😊😊
bros glazing the product
Patawa ka boi samsung display lang din naman yan e tsaka bulok ecosystem nyan compare sa samsung e camera lang naman Habol ng mga bading dyan....
"I've been a Samsung Flagship user for as long as I can remember. And sabi ko I might consider iPhone pag nag redesign lang sila. And since medyo disappointing yung S25Ultra, kaya last week iPhone 16+ nlng binili ko. Pero secondary phone ko pa din tong iPhone. Primary ko pa din is yung S23 Ultra ko. Boring kasi ng ios. haha! Mas madami ka pa din pwede magawa sa Android not to mention apk files."
iiyak din bulsa mo dito!
Single sim with esim yan boss?
Di pa pala sim-free jan sa Pinas
I almost skipped the vid coz of the annoying pic. But he’s a nice guy naman pala. Just hope he’s front image (if that’s how you call it) matches his nice personality
Ako na naka iphone 6 parin huhu
Red magic lang malakas
misinformation ka po lods walang iphone 11 mini😂
"one thing you’ll always see/hear in his review are positive comments in the phone/tablet he's reviewing, never the cons"
I am iphone 16 users
Mas maganda parin ang cammera ng s25 kesa jan try nyo sa kabe try mo dali ikumpara mo ung 15 or 16 mo sa s22 at s25 sali para malaman mo ang pinag kaiba
"Sulit yan, iphone 16 base model , black color.. napaka semple lang.."
Ang pangit talaga ng iPhone overhyped lang pero wala binatbat sa china phones lalo na as picture
comedy tlga to pg nag review..🤣😅👍
does it even have .5 for $600
I will  not buy a phone like that  în 2025 .The screen is one 60 hrz and the noch is ugly
Best 2010 phone 😂
"Alwasys a fan of GSM Arena for integrity, this seems kind of off to me."
Waste of money
Better than a buggy android for sure
Apple think 💬 lets make a joke tadaaaaaa iphone 16eeewwwww 😢
"That throttling is damn quick, you'll only get the best performance for a very short burst."
They should name it iphone xr 2 so no one complain for the price increase. 😂😂😂
Lots of stupidity in these comments.
"I moved from Xr to 16e, felt like exactly the upgrades needed for my phone at the price of 50k ₹ including exchange, after 6 years of usage. I’ve been using iPhone since 14 years and I’ve lots of data on iCloud, well my budget for my phone will always be 50k, getting an iPhone within that price is more than sufficient for me"
Apple Mafia 👎🏻
"Iphone 16""e""xpensive for no apparent reason."
Who's here in 2016?
iPhone 4 lookin ahh
This iPhone doesn't have expandable storage? None of the iPhones over the years ever have!!!
coming from ipX and huawei p30. Is it worth it to buy this 16e over 13 both brandnew? Since in our country only official reseller only and no apple. I really dont need the extrea features. I just want a phone that works well for a long period of time.
"Pathetic battery, 60 hz display, 800 nits, slow charging 

For $599 -- sure, Apple! 🤮"
Regurgitated crap
"S,🥦🥑"
better battery = better phone.  16e all day.
125 GB iPhone 16 😂😂. Very unusual of Aaron to make such error. But great video as always ❤
"16e, save $200 without pay for some functions i don't care"
"Neither, get a refurb iPhone 15 Pro."
@zollotech how to clean type c port filled with dust ?
"I would not order a 16e as I am using an iPhone 📲 16 Pro and love ❤️ the camera features and performance. It would be a downgrade. Great video, Aaron!"
"I thought the 16e had optical stabilization as well, just not the one with sensor shift?"
16e display is missing LTPO which might be why you find it harder to look at w.r.t. PWM
Nice video
I am using iPhone XR how to save battery in sunlight
In sun light my battery drain so fast
in europe 699€ for the 16e 128gb. thats redigilous!
None
don’t buy iphone 16e
Both with their own disadvantage
I think the 16e is a great device. Yes the price is fairly expensive but everything has gone up in price and you have to look at what’s inside it. Amazing battery life OLED screen at end of the day it’s an iPhones and iPhones are not cheap they are a luxury item.
"Hear me out, Get the regular iPhone 15 and call it a day. You will never notice anything different in day to day use."
So yourself a favour if thinking of getting the 16e due to budget and buy a refurbished iPhone 15Pro or Pro max for same price. If you do need a new 16 phone go for 16 . The lack of wifi 7 makes a massive difference also
i will buy iphone 15.
I got the 16 pro max because I care about having the best possible camera. 🥲
Sorry panget ng audio naten dito!!! Nakalimutan ko on ung noise cancelling ng DJI 🙃
apple ran out of idea
Waiting po sa xiaomi 15 ultra at xiaomi 15 pro😅
Well I just got my 16e today❤
samsung a36 review po☺️
Dapat ung tinawag nila dito iphone xr 2 para wala masyadong magrereklamo
Lugi kayo dyan sa presyo at konting dagdag nalang iphone 16 na o sa mas mura na 15.
Ang nagustuhan ko lang talaga dyan sa iPhone 16e eh yung battery life at pwede maglaro ng resident evil at assassins creed. Sa camera I can live with it kase ok pa din naman ang kuha.
Can we get a review po ng samsung s9 fe?
16 plus nmn
iba parin ang samsung Ai
Kailan release sa pinas?
Binili nyo na po ba sya as secondary phone? Pede gawa ka ate mary ng full review hehe
Why are u bothered about 60 hz ip 16 also has 60hz
"Nilabas ito ng apple para lang talaga sa mga minimalist phone users. Black and white color, single camera, walang dynamic island at mga abubot. Nakakasura lang yung mga bashers. Hinahanap nila yung features sa 16e na makikita naman nila sa ibang model ng 16 series or sa lower models. Kaya nga special edition. This phone is not for everyone. Yung price lang talaga ang ka bash bash sa phone na ito."
We need a full review of that mam
Are you gonna review A56 of samsung?
hindi mo na na review si reno 13😭
Xpensive sya for me. Bibili na lng ako ng ip16 na secondhand halos same ng   price.
Love watching tech reviews that I can't afford 😂 sana all may pambili ng iphone
"Hey Chaps! What iPhone are you using?? (or none!)
CORRECTION: iPhone 15 also has a 48MP Main, and the 16 Pro's do have faster wired charging."
Really don’t understand why every one hates on 60hz? Its really not bad
I want fun colours for the pro models
I bought an iPhone 13 Pro Max when it first came out and after 2 to 3 years it’s acting like it needs an update or replacement and been considering getting a 16e !! 🤔 ???
The beautiful city of Wells!
To be honest probably 97% of the people who buy iPhones could care less about the  refresh rate. That is tech reviewers trying to convince people to care about it.
"best video i saw about this, thank you!"
I like iPhone 16 plus :(  anyhow just for personal use :)
"Wow, Wow...this video is brilliant. It really is. It made me realise that I really don't ever need all this Pro features that I was aiming at. and they are overly expensive. What is important to me is a solid battery, a big screen and a nice camera (but not necessarily a zoom lens). most of my pictures and videos are and will always be taken in medium to well lit environment and up close. I almost never play games and mainly use the phone for the youtube content , online shopping, emails, photos/videos and phone calls, thats it.  So, for all of the above the iPhone 16 Plus ticks all boxes  with flying colours. Hooray !!!... Tnx for the great effort you put to make this well made and very informative videos. Ta."
Love your review
I've never commented on any review but I have to now. I'm now choosing between 16 and 16Pro. Thank you for ver detailed video! Amazing!
Honest review love it 😊
"On your 16 promax that you got the crack into the screen. That is a defect definitely. Take it back to Apple and get a brand new phone ,that should’ve never happened and you can’t go around with a cracked phone."
60hz ? No thank you !
Once they put 120hz on the regular model. The pro will be pointless.
I just got iPhone 📲 16 today 😅
I never considered the iphone 16 but after this video I think it’s the one I am getting 😅
The only downfall of this device is 60hz which isn’t that bad especially on iOS but they can give 90hz at least I think if they don’t put that or higher in the base 17 some people will switch but some don’t even know better I got my about a week ago it’s nice
IPhone 16 plus 256 GB is enough for me but more concerned about 60 Hz screen refresh rate or will just wait for iPhone 17
pro raw max vs heif max is what is the best photo quality for iPhone 16 pro
Got the new iPhone 16 on my Birthday today! Pretty good timing if you ask me! 🎉
Doesn’t it have 3 cameras the iPhone 16
Teal more beautiful
Guys IPhone is just a yearly subscription but it increases by $100 each year
Get the 16e
People just be saying they are the same thing every year for no reason
Happy Birthday Kyle Kruger🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
I have the ultra marine color iphone
3 iPhones are wild 💀
Iphone is nothing more than a jewelry
"Next thing you see ""no box""😂"
Can I have one?
💀💀💀
"I’ve been using the XR for the past 2 years, just got the 16 & it’s not much different 🤷🏻‍♂️"
I want the iPhone 16+ in my birthday. Do you know how many gb I want 512 GB
"""This is the new base model iPhone... OH GOD!"" got me rolling on the floor 😂😂😂
































""I was fine with no charger brick BUT NO STICKERS?"""
i have the black one
"I had the 13 pro for over 2 years and wanted a new phone so decided to go with the 16. the second I started using it I waned my money back. I'm telling you guys... don't get a 60hz phone when you're used to 120hz, it's the worst thing ever!"
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Bro it's literally the same thing just an ugly model cuz they kinda stole OnePluses model cuz it.looks better
I went from a iPhone 12 and got a iPhone 16 blue and omg I’m so in love I definitely do see a difference in performance. I not in to big phone so the 16 is perfect 🤩
People keep talking about screen refresh rate like it is the end of the world …justt give it 2 weeks and you will get used to it … i know that iphones are generally overpriced but 120hz wouldnt justify the price by any means …this phone is capable due to its powerful hardware(processor Ram battery camera ) and fine software (dynamic island integration with a lot of apps..navigation through phone ..connection with other apple products …then someone come and say if onllllly it had this mf 120hz
"For someone like me who isn’t going to be playing these high quality mobile games, how will the 60hz actually effect me"
"I have been debating what iPhone to switch to (currently on the SE 2). I thought the 16e would suffice, but after this review and a few others, I will be getting the 16. Both are better than my SE 2, but I want a great camera, mag safe and the pretty blue color."
First video to watch on the channel. Good review thank you. Bro kinda looks like davie504.
"Automatic downvote for the ""I'll tell you at the end of the video"" about forty times. Just tell me bro. Stop trying to trick me into watching the whole thing."
Niiiice your iPhone has the SIM card tray I’m trying to find one to buy online but all I’ve found is this Canadian site that isn’t user friendly to navigate lol
Even the Samsung s24 is better than the i16
Tesla😂😂😂
Well darn. Wish I had seen this before I bought the 16 pro.
Had no idea Jay from Inbetweeners went into vlogging
What video game is this ?
I can't believe you are trying to justify 60Hz refresh rate on a flagship phone and that useless inconvenient camera control button.
I switched from 11 to 16 the blue colours and this phone feels like the old but bigger camera and faster
I could not go back to 60 hz anymore.
"possibly the best base model iPhone since the 13, unless Apple releases the 17 with Pro-Motion"
I struggle to understand some of what this guy is saying. He sounds like a Spaniard speaking English with an American accent but I keep missing some words.
"7:03 I think 8k 120fps is more worth it than spacial video.
Spacial videos got some sort of lag, and the resolution is not great at all."
Why don't they have dual sim slot?😢
"I'm comparing the iPhone 16, 16 Plus and 16Pro on the Apple Australia site, and the Pro wins by a mile.

I downgraded from an iPhone 12 Pro Max to an iPhone 13 mini (and love it) which by all accounts is shitty compared to the modern counterparts.
If I WANTED to upgrade, I'd save up for the iPhone 16 Pro."
Are there any iPhone 16 features I am forgetting 🤔 SUBSCRIBE if you like tech!
Basically apple just took the iPhone 15 and added a camera button and called it iPhone 16 and charged another 100 bucks.
For extra $100 I’d rather have the 16 pro ohh I do a white one 😜
Just buy the 16 pro in 2 or 3 years
Boy I bought 16 yesterday and why are you saying this now😒 of course i don’t regret
"60hz display on that welfare model you bought. No one bought that phone bro. It’s honestly a legend, I have never seen one in my life. Everyone was sold a pro or pro max with a 120hz refresh rated screen. You’re the only one with that broke boy phone. Literally never saw one in real life. 800$ and for 100$ more you could have gotten what you actually wanted 😂😂😂"
"Do not buy iPhone, buy Samsung S series. I regret that I bought iP 15 😢"
Premature celebration.
"lol, I just bought an iPhone 16 😂"
😂😂😂 do you think I'm f****** care
Umm my dad got it for my sister and she traded her other phone for an iPhone 16 so once my dad bought it it cost like 300 idk but it’s cheaper than whatever you said but yes I know why it’s cheaper it’s cause my sister traded her other phone
"Apple knows this. That last year pro models are better than this year's base model. If you go on their website, the last year's pro model is oddly missing."
Womp womp. I have it😏
Bro I jst upgraded from a Samsung to the 16 let me enjoy it in peace 😭
"I actually bought my first iPhone in February 8 2025,we got it for 138 just because at&t where having a sale,the monthly bill in 11 dollars a month,how cool is that?And I rate the phone a 10/10'"
The iphone 15 pro doesnt have 120hz display on the website. Thats false
The 15 pro doesn’t have apple intelligence in Germany unfortunately
Too late
I’m watching this video in my iPhone 16
"""this turbo flex pro 2nd generation ball is much better then this 5th generation turbo flex base model because look at all these features *lists all features that ofc pro model would have and ingores other advantages*"""
"Guys, I need you to help me choose between the iPhone 16e or iPhone 15. Which one is better?"
iPhone 16e is even faster than the 16 Pro Max …. If you don’t care about iPhone’s 60fps because it is smooth and if you have a tight budget then probably got for this for gaming because faster speed
"It's not just iphone 16 has ultrawide camera but the main camera is far better than main single camera of 16e. Just because both are 48mp doesn't mean it would be same that's because 16e uses ultrawide camera but tuned to be main camera. The issue with that is regardless of resolution ultrawide camera tend to not give details same as main camera even if main camera is not 48mp while ultrawide is. 16e camera has all the issues of a ultrawide camera in both photo mode and video modes. Also just because I said 16e main camera is 48mp ultrawide tuned to be main camera doesn't mean it's actually using ultrawide from 16 series, it's actually older 48mp ultrawide from older iphone had which means it's even worse than ultrawide from 16 series"
"useless massive screens 
swipe up is a big BS 
iphone 6/7/8 were the best"

"If you are with T-mobile and also a Costco member, now you get a full $500 trade-in credit (for most phone like iphone 11 or later, Samsung S10 or later) at Costco Tmoible kiosk (depends on your plan), plus $100 Costco GC per line, the activation charge is always waived at Costco. Max is 4 lines per account. Just got 3 x Pro 256GB, 1 x Blue Plus 256GB (have 3 x Pro Max already, really don't like Pro Max, heavy, big)."
No 1 likes apple 🤢
Apple prioritizes the performance and build quality which I love the most...
Apple is  looking for some customers not for all. Their Budgets phone prices almost matched higher in others.
I love Apple Products...❤❤❤

Nice comparison video
"Strange, Apple tried to drop the Price to rope in more people and increase their revenue$, …but due to the overall poor quality & features, it’ll probably backfire and anger many first time buyers never to buy another iPhone.  
Thus: “You Get What You Pay For.”"
Useless device at this whopping high price.
ESR has a case that adds MagSafe on Amazon for 17$ and works just fine.
Should have just used the A16 from the iPhone 15 and sold it for 499. Apple AI is vaporware and is delayed again until iOS 19 or even iOS 20.
The device was indexing.   If you went to about it would have showed you that.   Additionally if you have iCloud photos on when you set up a new phone it optimizes all of them for that device Thuss also slowing it down the 16e is by no means slow or laggy
"Nah. MagSafe is extremely convenient and I can’t imagine having a smartphone without it. Also, UWB chip is something my family really needs as we use AirTags. And precision finding is truly  important to us."
I am using an iPhone XR and I'm thinking of upgrading into an iPhone 17 when it will be released on October. I have changed its original battery it has 97% battery health and I can go through the day no problem. Still supports the latest iOS version minus the latest features of course but for my usage I don't feel it's lacking significantly. Maybe in low light photography but even then you can adjust the filters and make the photo usable ☺
"Wow! 
Haven't seen one of your videos in years. 
The wifi comparison is just what I was looking for. We have a 1gb Mbps account. I get up to 600mbps on my 8+. Yeah. I know. Time for an upgrade. 
On my Android there's a small ""6"" with up and down arrows next to the wifi icon. That's wifi 6? Sorry. Dumb question"
it's a cheap garbage phone from apple so pathetic that apple still bring back the notch and put 60hz that is such a delusional move from them even the new nothing phone 3a and the galaxy a56 offers a lot of features than this crap
Apple made a cheaper premium iPhone. The ‘missing’ features are things that most people won’t miss. 😂😂😂
"Thanks for raising the PWM flickering issue! More people know about it, more they can connect the dots about having eye strain and headaches after using an OLED phone."
"What do you mean by ""It doesn't have stabilization""? This camera have OIS, you can see it in official specs on apple website."
I considered this for my girl she had a iPhone 12 I ended up getting her a great condition iPhone 14 Pro for 300 instead of this I feel like I made the right decision
PMW is actually a dealbreaker. Do you know if it’s any worse than  iPhone 13 or 14?
Had mine for about a week got it on preorder. What I will say performance is definitely lacking when the battery is under 15% unlike most iPhones where it’ll be pretty solid until it dies. However I have no other gripes the screen is amazing the response is fantastic I’m typing this from the 16e it’s durable I’ve dropped it and got no scratches or anything. No issues with T-Mobile and my T-Mobile credit gave me this phone for free you need anything better than a Walmart family mobile phone but most phones are accepted!
Already on sales in Asia. Abysmal sales😂😂😂
In the settings menu the black color (dark mood) looks very dark and I like it this way! How can I make it as dark as yours ?
Charging your phone wirelessly at 7.5w will degrade the battery. Could've been scrapped.
I would hope the 16 pro max is better. It cost twice as much. Apple website lists it at $1199.
"The iPhone 16E is trap in an iPhone 4 w/o the headphone jack & an iPhone XR like camera.Also, this has the price of the iPhone 11."
"Please pay attention to the forced labor issues at Apple's Chinese supplier, Desay Battery factory. Workers are required to work at least 10 hours a day; otherwise, they are considered absent and will have three days' wages deducted"
Wow phone company’s are so creative 💀

Women only care about the design and colors.. men never
"...
After watching this Video,  I have immediately ordered a 15 Ultra.... 16 GB + 1 TB... On the official Website for Xiaomi there is a 200 € early bird discount and a 200 € worth gift...

That is so attractive owing to the fact that Apple can not even do a simple split-screen funtion... 🙂‍↕️👍

Thank you for this Video...."
"Once considered a cheap iPhone rip-off, now neck to neck with the same. What a time to be alive!
This just shows that all htc, LG etc had to do was to keep making great phones and actully make them available to purchase by the end consumers."
Battery on xiaomi phones is generally incredibly from personal experience
I feel apple gonna bring an m series chip for apple abandoning the A series
"Noticed quite a bit of stutter on iPhone on Google News app, app store, twitter etc, no? Ive also recently tried out 16PM & normal 16, and I'm just going to ignore the 16(e) because that 60Hz feels horrendous. I don't really understand people who like to say it's equiv. to 120Hz on android (on what android? some $200 android from 2018?), and honestly just going through UI and browsing just straight up feels smoother on HyperOS 2 vs. iOS. I've gotten used to HyperOS 2 so iPhone actually felt a bit sluggish to me. And I'm seeing it in this video, too. 
But don't get me wrong, I don't like HyperOS, I still often find small annoying bugs. Very inconsistent experience.

Sidenote: the reason why android phones are so focused on ""optimization"" and ""speed"" nowadays is due to it being super-trendy in China. It's like a marketing flex, or something."
now do multitasking with the best full sized split screen phones while its opened.
But the 2025 iPhone 17 pro max with slap all androids lol I don’t care really
90% of these people don’t own/can’t afford neither an iPhone the samsung nor the xiaomi and yet put so much hatred on the iPhone because its the best and the beast 😂
"My best phone must have these specs: 200 megapixel camera, IR Blaster, 1TB, Wet Enhanced Touch 2,0  (shoots underwater & on wet screen), eSIM,  shatterproof front & back, 120Hz refresh rate, 6000 mAh battery, 120w hyper charging,  wireless & reverse wireless charging,  robust speakers, 4k recording,  AI Tools... Now these specs are on the Redmi Note 14 Pro+ 5G, Honor Magic 7 Pro, Vivo X200 Pro,  OnePlus 13, Oppo Find X8,  Huawei Mate 70 Pro Plus (indestructible, unbreakable) , Redmi K80 Pro, and the mighty Xiaomi 15 Ultra. Respect China🇨🇳"
"iPhone 16pm 18.3 I have seen it in 8800 multicore and 3550 in single core... anyway, the fact that one has 16gb of RAM and the other only 8gb of RAM says a lot... I think they need to improve the scrolling and I think it's because the 120hz doesn't work constantly, that's why that happens..."
"Xiaomi then:So b😒ring.
Xiaomi now:😯MG!"
"It feels 60hz because apple doesn't fully utilize the 120hz while scrolling it keeps it fixed at 80hz for that ""elegance"" (acc to them)."
A Strange year for the iPhone...
Dude where is the new MacBook Air video?
Camera control is one of the most dumb feature I have ever seen
"Hey guys, I'm using a 12 Pro Max. Should I upgrade to the 16 Pro/Pro Max or should I just get the 15 Pro/Pro Max and save the difference for accessories and other stuff?"
Ain't desert titanium just a fancy name for rose gold?
2025 is critical for Apple to Bring Exciting iPhone -Atleast 1 New feature that's Mind-Blowing 🤞🏻
"so when tim cook said, apple intelligence built from the ground up for apple intelligence & break through a.i.  !, so when he said @ the end ""brake through intelligence"" does that mean copy what google & samsung has already done then wait a few years later before apple brijtsvit to you our consumers because here @ apple we love everybodies money, we do not discriminate unless its the latest & greatest tech & a.i. well then we do discriminate until google & samsung brings it out first for a few years until we can see nobody is against it, then we will slowly roll it out when its safe for us to bring to you are overlooked customers, is that what apple intelligence is, i want a refund ! tim cook , u ma fucca, u !"
the smartphone market is saturated to a higher degree there is no innovation no more.
I got the new iPhone. It’s pretty nice. Size is very good. 6.9 (nice) is perfect.
honestly the camera control button needs way more improvement. Very counterproductive now. I still prefer the old Ring/Silent Switch over the action button which everybody only binds to flashlight??
"Hear me out dave, the camera control is actually to take selfies form the rear wide angle camera. That's it here we go a game changer"
Still waiting for my AI update in the Netherlands. 😂
Dave ? What about glitches
What Pokemon game was show in this video ??
"I have been using the iPhone 16 Pro Max for two months, and it has been experiencing serious issues, such as sudden restarts, becoming unresponsive, and Siri not always responding. As for the camera, there is a significant problem with lens reflections that affect both photos and videos. I can’t even capture a sunset or a simple lit candle. Due to all these issues, I have decided to sell this iPhone. I am very disappointed, and it’s a big shame for such a large company to provide mobile phones with such major problems at this price point."
No intro. No outro. No music. No BS. Straight to the point. Dave is showing how it's done!
"i have been using samsung note 20 ultra for the past 4 years (this is the 5th) and i was considering buying the 16 pro max for a change , you think it's worth it ?"
"The 'new button' has been such a nice upgrade, reminds me of quick-launch features of the Moto X series. It’d be awesome if they made the button multi-functional with tap combos or something. 

Also, the Siri + ChatGPT combo feels like a solid move in the right direction. 

I upgraded from the 12 to the 16 Pro, and it was such a big jump. Honestly, the 4+ year upgrade cycle just makes the new features feel so much more worth it."
"In 5 years, I'd rather opt for nextgen ""Smart Glasses"" from Apple/Meta/Samsung/Google..., onboarded with embedded AI, embedded ultrahigh-res camera lenses, 6G connectivity (eSIM), augmented reality, Holographic I/O interface and amazingly efficient voice/image/video/gesture driven Search interface , killing the legacy search and exploration via mobile browsers running on smartphones."
"another useless button. we have 5 buttons now in the phone. 

Apple should add sensor triggers, bypass charging, shrink the size of the front camera, add thurderbolt 5, add 4k60fps in cinema mode, add touch id in power button, get rid of action button and new camera button, increase watt power for charging, use the new technology for increasing of the size of the battery in iPhone."
8:55 is the time code for the 60hz discussion
Clicks looks 🔥 no lie 😂
Love this Channel! Question: Do you prefer to use phones with or without cases?
"Somebody give me a ""clicks"" for my Nothing Phone 2a 😭😭😭. I am one of those who used a BB till 2024 (though mine were all without keyboard after 2015)"
I went to 16PM but I did think about the 16 base
totally agree about the camera button location...very weird design choice.
"There was a period of time where I had Pro models of iPhone, iPad and MacBook all with ProMotion.

100% saw the difference compared to 60Hz devices and was loud about it, showing it to others and making a point of how 60Hz wasn't good enough. No one else cared (or cared enough, at least). It was just a mild interest to most people, and certainly didn't spoil their 60Hz device for them.

Over the years, I've walked back down the product line to a MacBook Air I chose for thinness, and an iPhone 16 I chose because I didn't need all the stuff on my last Pro iPhone. Maybe takes a short while to get used to again, but it's not life changing. I don't spend loads of time missing it or wishing it was on the lower end products, and I get why Apple sees it as a fit compromise. I'm sure they've done the market research to know that the average non-technical non-Pro customer does not see it as necessary.

I'm never gonna be one who actively asks for less, because getting more for your money is always better. And if Apple put ProMotion screens in the standard non-Pro products I'd definitely be happy. But I can definitely see why Apple chooses to draw the line with ProMotion as a Pro model feature."
It’s so crazy I honestly never seen one of your videos today on accident and then I saw your a cofounder for clicks which I don’t personally use but I am a manager at an Amazon pickup returns store and had a customer come in the other day with it on his phone and he was telling me how great it is and had me using it trying to troubleshoot a return for him and I was actually looking into it weird how everything just circles around
"Currently own a iPhone 13 Pro Max and I’m considering for the first time to purchase a base model 16 Plus, anyone else done this?"
Seeing that phone not in a case is making me nervous after you broke your razr
Electric Blue Dance Bugaloo
"Clicks is such a bad product. I mean it's a cool nostalgic idea, but playing with it, it's too much. Plus it's too expensive and not convenient."
Clicks is utter useless. Why try to solve a problem which doesn’t exist?
Nice explanation brother
"threads
lol"
all these tech YouTubers calling for foldables are so annoying.
"The difficulty in switching is up to the individual who is switching. Depending on how deep into apple's ecosystem you are the harder it is. If you own everything apple, apple watch, airpod, ipad, some crappy apple laptop/desktop then yeah switching to android is going to be a nightmare for you. And thats by design of apple. They want to hook their claws in, sink their teeth into you so you cant get out. Apple products do not play well with anything non-apple. And because apple is seen as a luxury brand and that extremely wrong catch phrase ""it just works"" (no it doesn't) most people think its the non-apple device that is having problems. And thats also again from apple with their marketing making it seem like android or windows are these devices that have tons of problems even though all of them are roughly similar in stability.

So wondering why the apple watch aren't as good when paired to a non-apple product? Or wondering why on android trrying to use that phone with your apple computer only for it to be frustrating as hell? Thats apple's fault. They don't wan to play nice. In doing so they hope your ignorant enough to go oh its the non-apple product that is the problem. And then either switch to apple or switch back to apple. 

Then theres the amount of stuff that just doesn't get transferred over when switching from apple to android. The ios specific apps that aren't on android either cause they are apple's products or made deals with devs to not bring them over. These are all breaking points meant to get users to stay with apple, or regret their purchase and go back to apple. 

However, if you are willing to have an windows pc, a samsung device with all the other samsung stuff, your experience will be 99% similar in use with apple. Most if not all the stuff you can do in the apple ecosystem is prevalent on android with windows pcs. Theres alternative apps and programs that perform at the same level or better depending on your pc and phone. You get a lot more freedom of choice for what you wan it to be. But again this requires you to abandon apple almost if not entirely. Trying to get apple to play nice with non-apple device is an exercise in frustration and futility."
No 16 pro review😢😢
Who cares of 120hz! I’m happy to my i16. 🙂
Anyone else slightly concerned that my phone isnt reading my texts and emails 'on device' ... And hence how secure is their reading of my texts emails. 😮
Are you tempted by the iPhone 16e?
The only thing I am missing from my pro max is the macro photos nothing else have better reception on Tmobile. And is so much lighter.
"Flossy Carter said it well,someone in this world will go buy one of these and call it great 😂"
"Sir, with the greatest respect, I find your reviews extremely confusing and quite often contradictory. 

What are you for? What are you against? 

I’m so confused."
I rather buy Iphone 16 than 16e
I thought the iPhone 16e should have had Touch ID on the power button and a punch hole camera on the screen.
I wanted to upgrade my iPhone SE 2 to this but in all honesty it was £100 too much. One reason or another I needed a 512gb version so I believe it would have been £799. In the end I got a referb iPhone 15 pro for less that the 16e price  and to have those additional features are great.
I have an 11 pro that is showing signs of a weakened battery. I ordered a 16e because I don’t won’t to spend more than that on another phone. I make social media ad videos for my service business. I’ll keep the 11 pro for that and use the 16e as a normal phone
Just upgraded from an iphone12 mini and couldn't be happier
the iPhone 16e is an iPhone from the past with features of the present. the only thing that would bug me is the 120hz….but the 16e is a clean clean device. if they gave the 16e 120hz and the dynamic island…..i’d buy it in a heartbeat.
3:10 iPhone 16 also has the same size.
"I did the same thing last week, except I went from 15 pro max to the normal 16. I just wanted something smaller and lighter. Will never look back!"
Could you give me the 16 pro max then ? I just subscribed
"The 16e.
No ultra wide band chip for Air Tag. No mag safe . No product red. I would rather buy a 15 pro when it becomes available on Apple Refurbished.
By the way, as the 15 would normally be 599.00 when the 17 comes out. I would like to bet Apple drop any 599.00 option because it would clash with the price of the 16e."
"I need the Apple ecosystem and I want to upgrade from my iPhone 14 due to usb-c charging. I’m tempted by two things: 2 day battery life and the hope of having better 5g connectivity in my area (austria), due to the new modem. I really don’t want the Apple Intelligence. I also hope the camera is at the same level with my iPhone 14. Should I go for it?"
"The 16e can only trickle charge on a wireless charger at 7 wats, if you do sports video then vids won’t have stabalisation, worst is it’s only 800 nits display outside .
I would definitely go the 16 instead. I use the 16 and 16Pro , they are both great sizes and I’ve been a max user mostly but this year changed. I do notice the 60 hz display.
The 16e is for I’m assuming for a second business phone or to buy multiple phones for employees, then again there are much better and cheaper great android devices.
You will definitely switch back to your 16 pro max or buy a 16 pro."
You need to considere the international subscribers I it so sad that because I am from Mexico I don have the chance
Does the find-my thing where it points you in the direction of the AirTag work on the 16e?
Best iPhone 16e Review  But there is one issue I don't can live with and this is the Ultraweight Camera I am not able to miss 
I have a Pixel 8 Pro and I had an iPhone SE 2020. I'm going to upgrade to the 16e... It has everything I need. An excellent phone.

"I dont hate iPhones, i m even of thinking about Getting a reburished iPhone 15 for Dating purposes... But Damn I have a Cricket Locked Moto G 2024 i bought at Walmart for $55 including Tax Brand New....EVEN That super budget phone has 120 hz 😂😂😂"
Is iphone 15 a better option than the 16e?
What do you think about going from iPhone 8 Plus to 16e? Is is a great upgrade? Thanks
This phone is a joke
"The iPhone 16e camera can zoom up to 10x, why don't you try it instead of keeping the 2x like the one at launch?"
I loved it too but I had to send it back because the camera is crap. The amount of motion blur is insane. I'm much happier with this iPhone 14 I got from Amazon
Meh  ..... I have a 15 Pro Max.
"""Worth it?""  Nope..."
"There are no refurbished iPhone 15 Pros in the UK on the Apple Store, so that is off the agenda. The nearest, the 14 Pro, is £740, so I would guess if they were in stock, they would be around £850, which is not competing on price with the 16E- instead, it is an alternative to the iPhone 16.

I would not recommend that anyone buy secondhand as you are at risk. There may be a good reason people sell their year-old iPhones, and at the average eBay price of £690 for the 15 Pro, that is chancy. 

If you buy new and want the entry point iPhone, that is the 16E. Negatives aside, as you can pay more if you need a specific feature(s), that is what you face. Androids punch with better bangs for bucks, but Android is not on your radar if you only want an iPhone. So, for businesses, my elderly parents, and iPhone devotees, this is what they will get. Paying £200 extra for features they have no interest in won't be sensible for them or millions of others. Get a carrier deal if you want discounts, or wait for the price to fall in the next 2-3 months on Amazon."
I upgraded from iPhone 11 to iPhone 16e. It’s best
"tldr – 16e battery life is poor due to new modem being inefficient and old screen being inefficient.

16e=11:53h
16=15:42h
16PM=17:18h"
"Hei 🩷

Vil du si at den tåler mye bruk til spilling og film ? 🩷"
Loving this phone so far!
"I have been using this for like 4 days and I love it, idk why my net is more. I really like the design.I dont mind if it has only one camera"
1 camera in 2025 for $999 Australia dollars 😂😂😂 apple rip off at its best
notch 😅😅
Even iSheep freaks can't defend this garbage.
bro it just been 1 week ofc it’s still worth it
i’m very shocked people are actually buying this £200 phone for £600
Our One UI 7 video is up in a mobile aspect for your phone: https://youtu.be/F22usek7xb0
Hello from Sofia 👌🏼🙏🏻
At least one 8 elite phone with weight under 200 grams.
"Anyone looking to upgrade from S10 to 25+. I did and it was worth it. Best part is you can transfer your old phone. My screen and settings are the same. Phone is much faster, can do more with photos. My service is much better as well."
"Thinking about upgrading to this🫠 love my pixel, but I want to try something else."
"It sounded like you are describing my s20 ultra specs , but missing  SD slot and the 5000 m.a battery 🔋"
Love a compact phone. For me a bigger screen is a downgrade.
"the fingerprint scanner SUCKS, it's fast but hitting it correctly is always a a challenge, it has only 4 fingerprints in storage and i I've remapped it 50 times now and still have to put my finger multiple times until it unlocks"
My s25 is still at service center from past 12 days. Samsung is pathetic at service. Tired of follow ups. The device didn't boot after disconnecting from a call when i was connected to android auto.
Update your Samsung and get a pink line on the screen for free........
"Sir ji, which one is the best out of : Samsung M35, M14, F14, M15 Prime, F15.  Give your 1 best selection of these."
Which city is it in the video?
"I like Galaxy and all. But once you go top end gaming phone you just cant fo back. Even the basic camera in most gaming phones is pretty incredible. Performance is second to none. I had a Nubia red magic 6r, which is a budget gamer, and no other flagship could keep pace. They were pushing a 90ghz display when almost every other top end device was still pushing 60. I dont even want to know how high the ram has got. While Galaxy had a ultra with 12gb and nubia and like models were pushing 16. Thats desktop power, and enough to do some pretty heavy gaming. New phones also suck with all the stuff they take away. Most people dont know what it is, but the ones who do miss MHL support. Some of us prefer a cable to do our mirroring and audiophile stuff. Wireless messes with things....wonder why"
"My dad switched phone plans and I'm getting this as a new phone, I'm still gonna miss my note 20 ultra..."
"The 25 and 25+ have the same camera, why compare?"
s25 having a 1080p screen....lmfao. Embarassing.
"Samsung has hit a new low, resorting to shady tactics to force consumers into upgrading their devices. The ongoing issues with the S22 Ultra, especially the failures caused by official software updates, clearly indicate a strategy of planned obsolescence. Countless users are experiencing dead motherboards out of nowhere, with no fault of their own, while Samsung refuses to take responsibility. Just look up the recent cases, and you'll see the truth. A once-respected company is now sabotaging its own customers. Shame on you, Samsung!"
"Just got mine today, to replace my S20 ultra 😅😊"
I have the s24 ultra. Should I upgrade to the S25?
Beautiful Sofia!!!
"Looks too much a like cookie cutter phone, generic, doesn't have that wow and no innovation factor. Disappointed."
"Until iphone make changes,  samsung will remain the same."
I'm disappointed with the lack of colors why is everything so boring now
I have a Note 10+ and thinking of upgrading but think it's worth it for me
All samsung products r 3rd class don't buy them . Only for loosers who can't afford iphone.
Dbrand is racist company. You should stop endorsing them
Hey @mkbhd does the s25+ also get 7 years of updates and stuff like the Google Pixel 8?
"4:42 ah yes, the Jraphics Interchange Format"
I came from the Nothing Phone (1) <- yes ONE haha the S25 Ultra is a fuckign improvement
Samsung offer 650 trade in for my pix 9 pro tempted
Yeah I don't like it looks like and iphone with the making the corners rounded but that's just me
My s25 is still at service center from past 12 days. Samsung is pathetic at service. Tired of follow ups. The device didn't boot after disconnecting from a call when i was connected to android auto.
I thought that was an iPhone at first!! Why copy it so close?
"I'm about to get a smartphone from my workplace and I'm pretty much on such annoying dilema:
Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus or iPhone 16 Plus ???"
"Samsung is a big name in the world of electronics. Samsung mobiles are the best selling. Galaxy S Ultra series is very famous.

 

This year S25 Ultra was launched. I bought it on 5th February 2025. The phone started malfunctioning from the very first day.

 

I went to the local Samsung service center, they postponed the matter. I went there again and again, finally they did a reset and software update.

 

Meanwhile, Samsung's customer care also worked on the phone.

 

For the last one month, I either wait for the phone or go to the service center and sit there.

 

Every time they just postpone it, they will do something tomorrow, they will do it after three days, Samsung has given me nothing but stress for the last one month.

 

I am 68 years old, I am a heart patient, I have kidney problems, I have blood pressure, I am diabetic, I take medicines throughout the day. My doctor advises me to avoid stress.

 

But for the last one month Samsung has brought a lot of stress on me.

 

My cardiologist is worried about my health. If tomorrow there is any effect on my life then Samsung will definitely be responsible.

 

I request with folded hands, never buy anything from Samsung. Once they sell it, these people do not listen to anyone, at any cost.

 

On Monday I will present my case in the consumer court. From tomorrow itself I will make posters in the city and warn customers through microphone - do not buy Samsung. Even Galaxy S25 Ultra turned out to be bad and no one is listening to me.

 

Beware of Samsung."
"After having the s24 for two years, I'm okay with having an S version of it - love it"
"Anybody wanna ship an s25 to Africa because they've got too much money to waste and don't know what to do with it..
 y'all are most welcome to send me🙏🏾😂"
"I pay 60 permonth, hw much you pay?"
"There hasnt been much change but i mean look at apple. After using iphone since the 3G, the switch to Samsung was life changing"
All I want is an upgraded Galaxy S10 with nothing changed to the outside except changing the curved to a normal screen and maybe move the fingerprint reader to the power button
"Thanks for having a bit of a look at my Samsung S25 review! If you've got one, let us know what you reckon so far - and if you don't, are you tempted?"
hardcore pornography😭
I hate these clickbait headlines. Discredits you big time.
The only reason i click on your videos is that you always have anime In your thumbnail
Just ordered My S25 Ultra Titanium Blue 512 GB.....Eagerly waiting for it to be delivered....this video made me happy about my purchase....upgrading from a Razr 40.....my first ever forray into the Samsung Ultra Series of phones....expectations are sky high.....hope they deliver.......
"Hey man, you should stop the Elon and Farage insults. Keep it non political."
You know the smartphone market is bad when you are considering a samsung phone...
Bigger the better
"Thanks for the thorough review as most other reviewers seem to have whined about it being a minor update from the S24 rather than showing what the phone is capable of. Moving from a 4 year old iPhone 12 it's been a major upgrade for me - screen, battery life, camera and overall snappiness have been worth it for me and I got a great deal through my employer with Samsung directly. Only downside is I maybe wish I'd got the 25+ as it is does feel even smaller than the iPhone 12 I moved from (or my fingers have gotten fatter). Only things I miss really are AirTag support and FaceID  (using the temperamental finger print scanner is a massive downgrade I wasn't expecting). Yes I know Samsung have their alternatives but they are ropey/insecure compared to Apple. Not a deal breaker for me though"
Watching on my s25 😂😀
"Why are their camera's so cack? Phones for most people are great screen, super fast camera for kids/dogs...then the processor etc"
"S25 has ridiculously rounded corners, Im not going to go out and buy a TV with massive rounded corners, just give me a screen with normal corners"
"Surprisingly enough at least here in the United States. There's about 50 million people. Maybe more that don't really replace their smartphones unless either a. They have no good battery life and they pretty much have to keep it plugged into a charger or b. It stops doing its software updates And becomes all glitchy that is when they then go and replace their phone. So there is a lot of people who do that. In fact, it used to be super popular amongst iPhone users to jailbreak your phones to get extra versions of iOS updates and security patches past what Apple was going to give you from the factory to make your phone continue to work even longer especially amongst the iPhone users that still had 32 pen charging port iPhones cuz when the lightning port came out it charged the phone fast enough that Apple started sacrificing battery life and had barely noticeable improvement in performance side note, I do also remember a company at one point that was making phone cases that had built-in batteries. So that way they could act as battery extensions to help you get more run time out of your cell phone for the day. Cuz there was a lot of Android smartphones at that time that if you wanted performance you didn't have a good all-day battery life The Advent of better car chargers than 5 w like 7 and 1/2 watt car chargers and even just 6 w car chargers at the time as well as the ability to easily carry a charging brick around and many public places like malls. Having power outlets that you could use already for charging your laptop and then companies releasing high-speed 10 w wall chargers as well to use to charge your phones that did not regulate their charging. So if you plugged a 10 watt charger into the phone it would get very hot and charge very quickly I remember one of my old phones with a 1500 milliamp battery going from being completely dead. Having died to being fully charged in about 45 minutes using a 2 amp wall charger because some of the early phones didn't have any power regulation and would just Chuck whatever they could into the battery."

What game is he playing at 6min
1:12 Lame virtue signal. Unsubbed.
"I could literally play destroy all humans 2 reprobed on it with the proper cooling equipment , this is by far the best phone chipset I've ever had yet"
Think the s25 is great. But my power button is wobbly/loose. Doesnt fit perfecrly to the body. Anyone more that notice this?
"Ex hardcore samsung phone user here. Not anymore. Changed to FindX8. Guess I got lucky since this time chinese phone doesn't let me down. Buying samsung at this point of time is like asking yourself to be scammed. Only great things about samsung is that they are king of customization. You can customize everything. Including recent apps menu, back, home stuff. They also got knox and samsung pay. 

Well that's what I can think of samsung as a long time user. But the downside is crazy. Switching from s23 to Findx8 makes you realise that samsung really is choppy actually. They got a lot of stutter. Maybe it's not fair to say that since it's 2-3 years difference of chip but the latest samsung doesn't improve either way. Also their battery life sucks so much. Switching because the green line being the breaking point. Make me realise that samsung is bad. X8 is crazy good. Performance, snappiness, the camera, battery life. Just crazy. People maybe not realise but samsung is really, laggy actually. People just turn a blind eye to it. When you restart the samsung, and unlocked it, the system is so slow. people would be like ""Just give it sometime, It needs to load up first"" or something. Not my X8 though. Right after restart, I can continue using it like it never restart in the first place. Not only that, X8 copy the good thing of apple like the smoothness and animation."
"Have been very happy using my S22 for the past almost 3 years but unfortunately due to a bad fall with no case, the screen started to fail after getting a black dot and now is flickering so much. I was wondering whether replace the screen and keeping the phone for 2 more years or enjoy the Samsung trade-in program plus some discounts to get the S25.

I love the size and how it feels in the hand. Photos have been great too and exepecting with the latest Snapdragon to get a better battery life compared to my S22, and that's a strong point too.

Great video with the all the needed details.

Cheers!"
Hola! ¿Sabes si para poryectar inalambricamente se usa como W11 o como smart view?
Why they don't bring this red color to ultras and folds instead of losy gray.
"Samsung should bring to us, compact smartphones for the mid range. I'm tired of huge and heavy smartphones. A battery of 5000mah capacity, fits perfectly in a 6,2 inches of screen. Look what google is doing with the Pixel 9a, 5200mah of battery in a 6,2 inches of screen. They could release a new mid range series, called Galaxy C, with two cameras and removing the macro"
Di Indonesia yg warna merah coral kok ngak ada ya aku cari2
Im kinda pissed that i didn't go to the website n order the red one... like i dont think i could ever forgive myself.  🦧
"I am considering upgrading to the S25, neither plus nor Ultra. Right now I have a Galaxy S10 which is in perfect condition, but I am concerned that neither ATT nor Samsung no longer provide security updates for my ""obsolete"" phone.  The size for me is also to my liking and the S25 seems to be essentially the same size. Am I being neurotic to be worried about the lack of updates?"
The fact it has better performances than the S24 by a lot and its so thin compared to any other samsung + the inexistent bezels makes it a awesome purchase
"i like the red color in your videos, but some people it seems more pink. sadly since its an exclusive color I'm unable to see it in person so is it really as red or is it a pink color"
Very sweet color.
Base model got the most updates.  4 gigs of additional ram and upgraded SoC. Too bad it didnt get the 1440p display and 45W charging.
I love the way you do these reviews.
"I wish I had wealth or income, because I want to buy it, especially in this color."
That Coral Color Is Reminiscent Of Nexus 5
Ne güzel bir telefon
"The worts thing about the 128gb one, it’s the memory technology: only ufs 3.1 (I mean, it’s not slow rom but, for the money…)"
Finally a compact phone!!
they offered free galaxy 7 watch + storage upgrade 500gb one for 500$ here in my country
Beautiful phone. ❤
Beautifull color samsung s25 ❤ and so tiny
Still to large ;/

"Well, the s25+ and ultra have better displays. I have no idea how anyone can use a small 6.3 inch phone. I cant go below 6.7 .. so i have the plus"
"No macro camera or UWB, unfortunately though."
"Compared to s23 ultra cameras, only thing i did is kept my 2 year old phone."
Those camera rings are ugly
What you think from switching to Samsung galaxy from iPhone

Faster and lighter than S24✅
"FINALLY someone talking about the s25 itself and not comparing it to the s24 and complaining. 
I dont have an s24, idk those features! I want to know about THIS phone
Thank you so much"
This is my actual smartphone. 👍
Just traded my Pixel 8 pro for one
"Nice video! I just upgraded my S21 5G to the S25+ (both 256gb). The size is not that noticeable, but I wanted a slightly larger screen, but not as large as the Ultra (and I don’t get the pen thing). I paid $649 from Consumer Cellular for 2 years interest free at $26 per month, with no trade-in. I have to pay it off if I leave their service, but their US based customer service is so outstanding, I’ll never leave. They’ll spend 45 minutes with you, and you can understand them. Need a credit? Just ask. 

At 4 years apart, they are similar. If using it for a phone mainly or reading news or YouTube (okay, I play slots sometimes), you may never see a difference as the S21 has 8gb of RAM, which isn’t shabby even today. I won’t max out the 12gb capacity of the S25+, so while I’m glad to have it, it isn’t that necessary. I’m not a gamer, so I can’t comment on that. I’d use a PC or TV if I were gaming. I’m not a photographer, so the differences in cameras aren’t that noticeable either. Most photos are deleted over time anyway, so cameras are as good as they probably need to be, except maybe for professionals, who would probably use a real camera. I mean, how good does a phone camera really need to be?

I’d say the S25 is too small for today’s phones and with the effort it takes to change phones, unless you just want a small phone, I’d recommend the S25+ for the .5” larger screen for $100 more, although the phone isn’t .5” larger. The S21 didn’t seem small when I got it, but over time it seemed to shrink, or my eyes just wanted things a little larger. I also wanted the latest processor because this is the 1st new phone I’ve bought in over a decade (I’ve bought used, refurbished). 

Unless you just want a tiny phone, if you hold the S25 and then the S25+, when you again hold the S25, you’ll definitely know you want the larger + model, which is only slight, but makes a difference. The good thing is, no matter which model you get, they are basically the same inside. If I had an S24, I would not have upgraded, even though it's smaller (same size as the other opening models). The performance would not be noticed and it would not be logical to upgrade unless it was nearly free. The S21 5G phone is so good I'd recommend it refurbished, or even from my eBay listing for it. It is a great phone and if it were an S21+, I wouldn't have upgraded to the S25+. The fancy bubbles and AI it offers isn't enough to have changed, but I am completely satisfied with it and will use it for many years after it is paid for."
"My s22 has had horrendous battery since day one, and it's gotten worse. thinking of trading in for this in hopes of better battery"
I use the pen a lot so I will stick with my 24U till it lasts. If they remove the pen I will switch to the S regular series.
"Phones are so creepy and intrusive nowadays. I don't want AI features, I just want good battery and a good screen. I don't need them sending my face into their AI schlop, I don't want to send data to them constantly. But unless I get a completely shit phone I'm stuck with AI. I hope there are ways to turn that crap off."
Really...too much AI GIMMICKS.... Many users don't have the time to figure them out.
Iv got this phone in mint
QHD isn't noticeable on s25 sized phones. Good call on their part.
"Great review, but please get a chair that doesnt squeek😂"
"The OnePlus 13 with the same amount of RAM and ROM is cheaper than S25 in Canada. Let's be honest, the OP 13 is faaaaaaaar superior and cheaper phone than the S25."
That blue looks nice thank you for making this video on the S25 not everyone wants a huge ultra.
Thanks and very helpful being that I just got a Mint one 😊
"Ngl, I'm returning my s25 ultra for the S25 mint green. This phone is just too big and heavy and I can't justify the small upgrades to the base model."
You can delete the ai right ?
"Helpful, thanks. I just purchased the s25 and not many comprehensive videos on it."
"Thanks for reviewing S25, for those of us that still care about more portable/ergonomic flagships."
Our One UI 7 video is up in a mobile aspect for your phone: https://youtu.be/F22usek7xb0
"i have the 23 plus, is it worth getting the 25 plus? ive seen so many different people saying it sucks or what not 😮"
Where does it stack up against my Pixel 9?
Viéndolo desde mi S25+ 😎💀
Aesthetically i like iphone but functionality aside from iphone don't shit on Android iphone 16 can't still can't do multiple screen
You are jacked
The camera looks pale to me.
I keep buying the Plus model because it does everything I need especially the battery life. I don't care for spens or foldables.
Who knew GSM Arena is based in Bulgaria?
Nothing said about new log shooting capabilities seriously nowadays i feel like gsm arena is making incomplete rushed videos
Hello everyone. So I just bought my s25+ yesterday and it's amazing. Fast smooth reliable. My question is like if you have s25+ does your phone heat up near the selfie camera. I mean around the top speaker area. Cause mine does. Little hotter than the rest of the area. So is it only me or..?
So basically a fancy S24 Plus lol. Nothing to upgrade over.
Thanks
went to the store to buy s25 Ultra but ended up buying s25+.. It suits my need enough than Ultra.
"just upgraded to this after having an lg v40 since 2018. i feel like squidward from spongebob: ""FUTUUUURE"""
"The ONLY review in either english, portuguese or spanish that I've seen being true about the battery life I've been getting for the past week or so, it's not what I was expecting (a day and a half), it's more like 15h overall"
samsung s25 plus or iphone 15 plus?
"Some reviews tells the camera is oversharp (when comparing to iphone and OP13), your review says it lacks sharpness (compared to ?)."
Just got this phone. Can you say something about the P65 warning on it. Thanks
"Confused between S25 & S25+ only because of two reasons (1080p Resolution and 4000mA battery in S25)...... What's your take guys? Are they concerning if I prefer a Compact phone, S25? Or should I go for safer option,S25+ ?"

S25 FE
The way you peeled the s25 ultra sticker 💀☠️
Can I get one pwease❤. I will subscribe
The cameras look ugly now ngl
Dawg thats my yearly salary😭🙏
"who hates i phone
👇"
25W charging in 2025 is wild
"Same to my samsung A15 too its color
Is nave too to mine"
Adding bigger rings on the same camera just to make an illusion to appear larger is just pathetic
"Same same, but different!"
"You're so pretty & beautiful.
We ❤ you."
That camera ring looks cheap
Give me one
How much money spend Samsung for advertising buy all tech tuber
Hey. Can you help make a decision on a s24 or the S25
Can I get one I am a college student plssssssssss😢😢😢❤❤❤
Is the icy blue actually blue or just off white?
CAN I HAVE ONE
this is actually the first time ive seen samsung release something not really that innovative lol
Please review the Rhinoshield SolidSuit for the s25 ultra.
Sooooo how much did Best Buy pay for that 12 seconds of promotion?
Lo mejor de este teléfono es que hace al S24 Ultra más barato
It's a phone. Live with it. Get a camera if it bugs you 😂 people who care this much need a little life awakener. IT'S A PHONE! OMG! Stop caring so much. Don't buy it if it's not for you 🤷
"So happy I'm not at all tempted to upgrade from my 24 Ultra. Money don't grow on trees, and I still love my phone so much"
"The cost of a new S24U in my country is about 800 euros but the S25U I can get for 980 euros, my question being, will itnbe worth it spending about 200 euros more and getting the S25U or should I just keep my money and get the S24U ?"
"I'm going to put it like this after using both phone for a month.  If you have the money get the S25, it's way better phone. If money is a driving factor in your decision, get the S24 it's still a great phone.  

I'm going to comment on the all youtube videos where people are crying over an S-Pen feature thats barely used."
They've been milking that 10 mp 3x sensor for way too long. This phone offers no value.
"So the mac in the background has now a pear logo, interesting 😅"
"I only got one because i really needed to replace my S21 Ultra and then Samsung offered me $1000 for my old phone if i traded it for an S25 Ultra. $400 for a flagship 512gb phone? Yea alright ill do it. 

Its fine. Gorgeous screen though."
Why this video is in hindi ??
Samsung ultra flagship has fallen
Can you make a video on how to import a phone not normally found here in the states?
there was a sale for my s24 ultra and I chose it over the s25 definantly love it
"Samsung takes something from iphone, it gets mentioned. I phone takes a majority of things from android, nothing is said. Samsung removes Bluetooth in spen, omg. Apple removed headphone jack and said it was for a good reason, yet if you tear them apart, they did nothing with that room lol. Its comical at this point cmon"
The ZFold is looking like it will be the same phone as last year with a spec bump too. It's a damn shame.
"Im getting real sick of lazy, basic ""premium"" phones. Looks like this will be red magics year."
The S25 Ultra thou is so much much better than the iPhone both hardware and software.
"Planning to buy S24 Ultra..I request user suggestion to go for it or not..my questions, 
1) did anyone face green line on screen
2) does it have tampered proof glass available in market

Thanks mates"
love the honesty! thank you for the review
Samsucks 😂😂
