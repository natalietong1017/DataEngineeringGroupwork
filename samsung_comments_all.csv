1:05 Correction: The back is Gorilla Glass Victus 2; ***ALSO our One UI 7 video is up in a mobile aspect for your phone: https://youtu.be/F22usek7xb0
"After two years, the screen is likely to develop a line, either pink or green"
why do they make the camera out
"On 5th February 2025, I bought Samsung S25 Ultra phone. I opened it up at the store and used it, made a video of it too, an app opened on its own, I thought that some setting was not right.

But this automatic app opening is still going on till date. I went to the local Samsung service center after just two days, they said it will get fixed on its own.

From the very first day, Now Brief does not appear on the lock screen.

AI does not work properly every time. I went to the local service center again and again, then they asked me to reset and update the software.

It did not seem right to get this done in a new phone, but there was no other way. I sat there for two days, did everything but the phone worked as it was.

Called Samsung customer care, they checked with the monitor, fixed the apps...the problem persisted.

Some concerned officer Mr. Nikhil Rai talked to me. I ordered so many things, I sent videos of apps opening automatically, sent photos of the lock screen in which Now Brief does not open.

Nikhil talked to me on Thursday, 27 February and said that he will call me on Friday evening between 4 and 5. I waited but no call came.

I called customer care again on Monday and they made me talk to Nikhil...then said that they will talk on Tuesday evening between 4 and 6.

I told them beforehand that I will not get this phone repaired now, now I want a replacement.

I waited again on Tuesday, no call came. Then I called customer care on Wednesday and they made me talk to Nikhil.

Nikhil again talked about doing some logging for which I would have to go to Samsung's service center. I told them that I have already said that I will not do all this now.

I am 68 years old, I am a heart patient, I have kidney problems, I am diabetic, I have blood pressure...it is not possible for me to go to the market again and again. I am alone.

My health has deteriorated due to this mental torture for one month. My cardiologist is worried.

Samsung has caused me financial, mental and physical trouble by giving me a bad phone. And they are making me run from one place to another.

If you are buying any Samsung product then keep in mind that the after sales service of Samsung is very bad.

Galaxy S25 is an ultra premium phone..no one is going to listen."
"The S25 Ultra is the best phone in the market, with some caveats no Bluetooth in the S pen and not much difference in the camera except for the ultra wide lens and the lack of a bigger battery but the S25 Ultra is still the best smartphone that‚Äôs widely available, if the Chinese phones were available more widely then it would be a different story and I can‚Äôt wait to get the S25 Ultra."
"It‚Äôs funny how much iPhone and Samsung are alike now, always copying each other"
"S25 (50 MP): 1/1.56‚Äù sensor ‚Üí Larger individual pixels
S25 Ultra (200 MP): 1/1.3‚Äù sensor ‚Üí Much smaller individual pixels

The sensor size increase from S25 to S25 Ultra is 1/1.56"" to 1/1.3""
But the increase in megapixel is 50MP to 200MP !
This is a trick to make it look `better`.

If Samsung had kept pixel sizes the same, the S25 Ultra should have had around 60 MP, not 200 MP.

The 200 MP resolution is over 3√ó higher than the proportional sensor increase, which means each individual pixel is significantly smaller. This forces Samsung to rely heavily on pixel binning to improve low-light performance, rather than just using larger native pixels.

The MP increase is way out of proportion compared to the sensor size increase. üöÄ
Don't fall for that marketing trick.

Consider that ""200 MP"" as ""60 MP""."
"The S25 ultra sucks.  As someone who is using it now. I switched from a OnePlus8t, and this samsung is a joke for its price point"
I really wish they would just bring back the expandable storage üò´
"Unpopular opinion? I owned S24 Ultra for 1 month only.
That phone hurts my palm so bad. Too wide, too boxy, too heavy. Even read some reviews that it could puncture their jeans. I couldnt endure the discomfort. And I came from most of the Note series so I am familiar with the feel of boxy phones, but s24U is just uncomfortable to use. Even using a case did not solve my problems. Sold it. Bought s25U and the difference is night and day.

S25U is A LOT smoother, faster, and very comfortable to hold. The ""hated"" curved frame is GREAT. The ""hated"" reduced weight is PERFECT. Like i could use this phone for 3-4 yrs. Almost perfect phone if it wasnt for the spen downgrade. But its fine for me. As i wont be using the spen shutter everyday, but id be holding my phone everyday ofcourse.

And the speakers... I owned a Note 20 prior to s24U and my Note 20 sounded a lot better. S24U's speakers sound so flat. I hated it so bad. Whereas the S25U probably has the best phone speaker as of this moment. Really punchy bass and great overall.

And oh, S24U overheats as well. I play games on my phone and even setting the graphics to minimum and low fps, it still overheats so bad. Whereas the S25U does not AT ALL. 

I was just so disappointed with the S24U that I didnt feel the upgrade and I came from only the Note 20 at that.

Maybe you cannot see huge improvements or drastic innovations on the S25U (and same, spen is a let down)... but samsung FIXED the things I HATED with my s24U. Hate is an understatement for such an expensive phone. Those things made me let go of my s24U and try the s25U. 

And I am just so happy with my S25U.:)
Titanium Gray variant is such a lovely color as well.

Hope people would just stop this train hate for the s25U.
It is an AMAZING PHONE. A LOT BETTER THAN S24U."
Watching with my new S25 Ultra 12gb+512gb variant
"please, i need some advice urgently now. i didn't like the iphone 16 pro max that i bought recently and i want to exchange it for a samsung s25 ultra or s24 ultra. what do you think is it worth?? because i don't know what to do.."
Looks no difference from s24.
"What city are you in in those pictures, it looks cool!"
I've got an S22 Ultra and I dunno man. The S25 Ultra looks like a downgrade to me. I wonder if there is a comparison video around. And can I use my old S pen? Is it's air gestures still compatible with this phone or did they just fully remove that functionality?
"Ive seen so many mixed reviews, im upgrading from a 21 ultra. Hope its worth the upgrade!"
Why the hell would they downgrade on stylus?
Guy‚Äôs high again. üòÇ
is s25 ultra for you ? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz8mDB_az9g
This guy speaks like an AI lol
Read the review on CNET.com:  Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus Review: Just Enough AI to Not Make Me Go Crazy https://cnet.us/zz9
Garbage
"Oh boy! You had me at the Carrington Mansion! I didn't know the name of it, but I knew it instantly when you showed the front of the _Dynasty_ estate (I'm rewatching it now on Pluto...lol). I still have an S21 and was going to upgrade to the S23, but the price is so low with my carrier ($649 for the S25+, interest free for 2 years). I usually buy a 2 year old refurbished one (like the one I have), but It makes more sense this time to get the newest one at $350 off. It has to be better than the one I have and really, there's nothing wrong with it, but it's 4 years old. I'll go get one tomorrow!"
Can i turn off the AI AM THINKING ABOUT GOING BACK TO SAMSUNG sick of AI
I still haven't seen any 1 asking for dam AI! SMDH
Thanks for this video.  Is there a way to disable the ai features in the Samsung camera app?  I film a lot of cycling content and often times film while I am riding.  I got this new phone for its video qualities and the video sound is terrible with any kind of wind.  If I am riding my bike and talking in to my camera it is almost like my voice will cut in and out and it muffles my voice to the point where you can barely hear it. Almost like I am talking under water or something. It will go to where you can barely hear my voice in the video and then will get super loud.  I did try to fix this with the audio eraser but it doesn't seem fixable.  And I do not want to have to fix every clip after I record it.  I never had this issue with my s21.  And I only have this issue on the camera app that comes on the phone.  I don't have this issue when filming in instagram or other third party apps.  Please help!
Cancers
Thanks for the video.  I'm considering getting the S25+. How useful will it be when I move out of the country and have a foreign carrier? Will I get the same updates if I were using a US-based carrier?
Can AI remove your head scarf so you don't look so oppressed by the patriarchy?
"I'm not even sure why I would buy S25 and S25+. Because most of these features and specs on these two phone are on the old phones like A series and S or earlier all have these features. Even on S Ultra, same oh same oh ü•±ü•±ü•±ü•±ü•±ü•±"
"Love the speed of the Snapdragon, but not much improvement in cameras from my S23. Also the screen is way more contrasty somehow and it looks like there's a beautification filter applied at all times, even when I receive photos from others. Not a fan."
"Definitely sick of hearing about AI. Still thinking about getting one of those phones though, but nothing to do with the AI stuff"
Hello! You are genuinely inspiring.
I hold the two devices the s25 plus is more cofmortable than the s25 ultra
Mashallah ‚ù§ the s25 is ok tooüòä
Im getting this phone tomorrow
So pleased the AI can automatically remove all letterboxes and replace them with hair. These poor women who suffer as slaves

"Samsung is a big name in the world of electronics. Samsung mobiles are the best selling. Galaxy S Ultra series is very famous.

 

This year S25 Ultra was launched. I bought it on 5th February 2025. The phone started malfunctioning from the very first day.

 

I went to the local Samsung service center, they postponed the matter. I went there again and again, finally they did a reset and software update.

 

Meanwhile, Samsung's customer care also worked on the phone.

 

For the last one month, I either wait for the phone or go to the service center and sit there.

 

Every time they just postpone it, they will do something tomorrow, they will do it after three days, Samsung has given me nothing but stress for the last one month.

 

I am 68 years old, I am a heart patient, I have kidney problems, I have blood pressure, I am diabetic, I take medicines throughout the day. My doctor advises me to avoid stress.

 

But for the last one month Samsung has brought a lot of stress on me.

 

My cardiologist is worried about my health. If tomorrow there is any effect on my life then Samsung will definitely be responsible.

 

I request with folded hands, never buy anything from Samsung. Once they sell it, these people do not listen to anyone, at any cost.

 

On Monday I will present my case in the consumer court. From tomorrow itself I will make posters in the city and warn customers through microphone - do not buy Samsung. Even Galaxy S25 Ultra turned out to be bad and no one is listening to me.

 

Beware of Samsung."
"It's never official for me unless it's from GSM Arena. The only channel I trust for phone reviews. No, BS, just facts.c"
Great phone. Except for the wifi keeps disconnecting bug. Did @Samsung #Samsung already fixed it? That was a major pain in the a$$ that got me to switch to an iPhone.
"Jerry rigs everything has already tested the new glass, and it's gone backwards as it now scratches at level 6 again, while the S24 ultra started scratching at 7!"

"3rd comment attempt. Comments disappearing after page refresh. I just received a new S25 and I worried about the small battery.  I'm currently using an A54 5G with 5,000 mah battery and I'm Very happy with it.  Should I be worried?  I may return it to Amazon.  It was an impulse buy. Comments?"

"Coming from an A54 5G, with 5,000Mah battery. Been very happy with the A54, wished I had read the specs of the S25 before ordering it. I may return it to Amazon, feels almost like an $800US a step back.  Comments?"
Still waiting for the OnePlus 13
"I don't think that the GPU is ""weak"" and needs a lot of improvement. In almost all cases, especially for games, you always want to have 100% utilization on the GPU on 60 fps minimum. If the GPU is not utilized 100%, it's either too strong or the game is not optimized for that SoC. We should compare it to other chips from mediatek, exynos, and apple aswell, and hoping they have the same render resolution and settings. That would tell if the GPU is already very strong or needs a lot of improvement."
"I'm confused between the S25 and S25 Plus. I prefer compact phones, but the S25 has just a 4000mAh battery. The S25 Plus has a 6.7-inch screen, which feels a bit too big.
Is there any noticeable difference in performance between the two?
Which one would you recommend?"

"2:57 High GPU utilization doesn't mean that GPU is maxed out if you don't take into account its current frequency. Obviously, it's power/temperature-throttling. Qualcomm's GPUs are powerful enough as is. What they (and CPUs) need is power efficiency."
"When you look for reviews of these phones by regular folk that don't care about how many likes they get, there not easy to find. No reviews about ""functionality"" My review after having this phone for 2 weeks is not good. When using the phone portion, may it be calling or receiving call's it freezes up. This happens maybe once a day. You cannot get out of the freeze even while your talking to someone. The screen goes blank, you then have to hold the power off button long press and then it goes off. It will come back up with no freeze, but will happen again with some calls. It's done it by even dialing a number, it will freeze then! I've had it for a month and will take it back!"
"The s25 ultra has the loudest and best speakers in the phone game, right now. That's coming from an iphone 16 pro max and 9pro xl owner.  Plus, you need to turn on dolby atmos. The speakers are 2nd to none"
Watching on my S25+ royal blue. Upgraded from S23. Excellent phone!
"I just ordered a S25 Plus, and I'm so excited."
"I currently have the S22+ and can upgrade in March. What would you all recommend, the S24+ or the S25+ ü§î I would appreciate your thoughts üòä"
jump from S24 to S25+ cant complain ü§†
Samusung speakers has always been bad :(
"Magic 7 pro and this are at same price but magic 7 pro has better speakers, better cameras and also has better battery if you can get 5800 mah global version."
Coloring issue? S25 series tend to project darker tone on colors like red and orange. Sometimes it's hard to differentiate between the colors.
yang ini ada samsung dex?
"My current phone is a Galaxy S9 Plus and I'm considering the s24 Plus ($860) or the s25 Plus ($1000). Any recommendations? Not sure if it's worth getting the 25 for $1,000 if it's not much better than the 24."
I got mine one week ago. All i can say is awesome. Upgraded from Galaxy A73 ‚ù§
"This phone is lightning fast, and it does everything you could ever want, plus the size is perfect. I switched from an s21 FE and the jump is crazy. I have no bad words for this phone, it's one of the only products I've ever bought that I could say is pretty much perfect. I also didn't have a problem with the speakers, granted I don't really care about them since I use headphones for everything (which might I add sound phenomenal on this phone with ultra high quality audio), the most use the speakers get is calls and the odd video here and there."
"Nice review my man, short, simple, and to the point. Subscribed."
ill take ur word for it bro
Att has free upgrades for S owners.  S21 to S25+ for free... pay sales tax

They did me dirty when I saw I couldnt charge my S25 with a 45W charger. The S23 of the same size has this capability. Wtf bro
The labels have to be backwards for low-light ultra-wide. The 25+ looks far better than the Ultra in that comparison.
"Nice review, just what I needed to decide üòÉ
But pleace notice: ""Aluminum has a density of 2.70 g/cm¬≥, while titanium has a density of 4.51 g/cm¬≥. This means that for the same volume, titanium is about 1.67 times heavier than aluminum"", according to ChatGPT, s√• Titanium is not helping the Ultra to be lighter ;-)"
I don't understand why companies keep creating gigantic phones. Those bricks are so uncomfortable to use.
S25 500gb perfect for me
"They need to give the S25 the same display, cameras, and specs so they are all 3 true flagships. I bought S24 and could get over that pictures/videos looked dull compared to my pixel 5 (which is almost 4 yrs old) and it turns out the PPI was much lower in S24 and it was so off putting. 
I had to settle for 24+ even though its a little big for my hands and gives me strain sometimes. 
I need a Samsung that's the size of the iPhone mini but all the whistles."
Samsung needs to get the bottom speaker placement right. Fingers block out most of the bottom speaker sound
"Upgrading from Samsung Z Flip 4, this will be my first ever Ultra device.....Fingers crossed, ordered S25 Ultra 512GB Titanium Blue......This video made me happy with my purchase, I was having Buyer's remorse......Expectations are high though....hope it delivers......I for a change, love the Red Magic Inspired Design....I still have my Watch 5 Pro and Buds 2 Pro that should work well with the 25 Ultra....and I think for someone like me, upgrading from a 3-4 year old device, this should feel like a big upgrade....let's see...."
"S25+ 6.8"" or 6.7""??"

S25+ is perfect
"Im considering the 25 plus or ultra as an upgrade for my flip 5... i like the portability of the flip 5, but the battery life and camera have been disappointing."
Theres an obsession on line yt especially with the ultra . Im pretty sure the international sales of the s25 s24 are 20 times the amount of the 24/25 ultra and 24/25 plus put together .

"""Not a big difference"" the phone literally having likew a 2x better processor"
I am confused why this expensive phone come in so cheap box?
it huge upgrade if we look at craponys s24

What phone do you currently use and will you be upgrading to the S25 Ultra? ü§î
MATE TOO BLOODY BIG ITS ALL YOURS
Who wants Ai. Thats just cheating. Plus i dont need internet ai stalking me then bombings me with ai  adds.
"I'll be getting the s25 ultra as a upgrade for my s23 ultra since I broke the display and it's mostly because glass screen protectors are annoying on curved displays and with this phone I'll be able to use the glass protectors like I did back when I used my Galaxy Note 3 till 2017 which is definitely more secure than a thin screen foil. That's why I used a iPhone for my business purposes. I could use glass screen protector because the display was flat.

My second reason was that I wanted to fully use my indoor wifi modems like the one hardwired in my Mercedes W201 and at all my houses after upgrading them in January.

Third reason is that my provider added a EU wide 100gb data plan for phones, where I got the S25 Ultra and the contract for ~40$ per month and even though my s23 ultra has 1tb storage and s25 ultra will have 512gb but I will be putting all my movies on my old laptop which I converted into a cloud streaming/storage server"
Doogee s110 upgrading to s25 ultra
"Honestly, I have a Galaxy S22, but I'm planning on upgrading to Galaxy S24 FE"
"I use a Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, I'm not going to change it to a Galaxy S 25 Ultra, there's no point, I'm happy with everything about it."
I went from the s22 ultra to the iPhone 16 pro max and I am disappointed. It feels like a downgrade. So I‚Äôm going to get me the s25 ultra which was my original plan.
Phones amazing..... best phone i have ever used
You like it becsuse of the iphone look which is great
"Where have you been, sir???
Welcome back!"
"I have upgraded to s25 ultra from
S24 ultra iam fully satisfied"
I have a s22 ultra and am waiting on the s26 ultra
"I have the 25ultra, it's one amazing phone !"
LMAO the phone companies just dont' know how to improve their devices any more because they got TOO DAMN GREEDY
"The s25 ultra is my daily driver. 9.5/10 Display, performance and battery life have been excellent. The anti reflective display makes a huge difference consuming content."
I love the price. $850 plus $100 Samsung credit today. So $750 after all discounts. That‚Äôs a steal
116.9 cm2 display area is cool.
I have s24 ultra i keep it because i dont see any improvement on s25 ultra nothing new just new processor that's it
I've got the S25 ultra and the Galaxy Fold 6. I use the S25 ultra for my everyday and the Fold 6 when I'm home. I love both smartphones and finally I'm keeping both instead of trading either one in. Thanks Samsung for the great smartphones and your trade in program that allows me to keep both.
Only in UK is the 512gb S25? coz' in the rest of the world is 256gb üò¢
Camera? ü§î
Lot of heating issues in S25 series. May be they need to bring update to reduce the clocking speed of the processor. High Heating issues found with normal usage
The battery performance is not bad. Met my expectation.
I got the S25 512gb the other day in the UK üá¨üáß
I am using s25 from last three days... camera is not like iPhone. Face unlock not working sometimes
3:20 I‚Äôm only willing to pay $9.99 annually (or a dollar per month) for galaxy AI if they start charging for it. With my time with the s24 I actually need the AI features that I usually use.
No they're similar to the S24. The S24 is better than the S25. Photos taken from the S24 have clarity and details than those from the S25. The brightness is also good on the S24 and the battery lasts longer on the S24 than the S25. I tried trading in my S24 with the S25 for storage upgrade but I will rather stay with my S24
I‚Äôd use a magnetic battery pack with it.

"Just purchased this new phone, For me its a bit of an upgrade I guess going from a S10 to a S25. So I am looking forward to it."
"Big mistake bringing out a new phone every 12 months now , nothing different . I have pre orderd an s25 because samsung are giving me 200 pounds trade in for a smashed  up A41 and double memory 512 free for price of 256 gb version and also another 100 pounds off code ,plus free ear buds 3 . I'm upgrading from an A53 and I can sell online for 100 pounds. So the s25 is actually working out cheaper than when I bought the A53 years agoüòÇüòÇ"
In Pakistan s25 starts at 12gm ram and 512gb
I believe there is a 512 GB available

"Check the wifi connection 5g and 6g. Someone complained about it for the Samsung Galaxy S25 ultra. 

Test that out please"
Big fan of new Exynos chips. Giving tough competition to Snapdragon
"Get $500 trade-in & $50 credit towards S25 purchase here ‚û°https://howl.link/cykq822oyhlwh
What are your thoughts on the S25? Thanks for watching!"
I got the S25 512GB Navy Bleu it's a pocket beast!
2:12 can I use 2 sim cards?
Which colour is this Silver or white
14pro should I switch I really like the design
"I saw that on the samsung store, i really like it too. But sadly im out of budget to have that üò¢"
I just got mine yesterday though my phone  company  and I got mine in navy blue and I really love this phone
I've just upgraded from S10+... really looking forward to it!! I'm getting it tomorrow üéâüéâ
So no AKG headphones in the box and no charger. What a rip off.
Certainly a very fast processing speed and the screen responds to the finger tapping much faster
I got the pink gold s25 512gb

How is it with gaming
I want it
"just bought the s25, selling my sony xperia 5 v"
"Apple's awful customer service I experienced with my last Iphone turned me off from Apple for life. I don't really partake in the whole brand loyalty thing between Android vs Apple, otherwise. Seems crazy to me a company like Apple would still have only just a 60 Hz display on their $1K+ phone in 2025 though. I'm not into gaming on my phone either."
I personally believe that the majority of people choose iphone because of the camera. I have an iphone 15pro and Samsung a05 but I use more the a05 just to save the battery life.
"It‚Äôs not only in bits that the Samsung display is inferior, but also in colour gamut. 
The iPhone can show more colours. 

The iPhone has a P3 colour gamut whereas the Samsung only has SRGB. That means the iPhone can display more colours and more shades of colour. 

P3 is preferred by professional photographers and videographers and desktop publishers for its colour accuracy."
Here in my country the price difference between an Iphone 16 and a Galaxy S25 is 30%. So there is not much reason to get an Iphone
"S25 is way ahead, no comparison."
S25 have the snapdragon8elit ...the base model of 25 series is more powerfull then top model of 16 series ... no others word

"I've upgraded from Galaxy S23 last week. Not much of an improvement, but:

Better screen (better brightness 1750 nit to 2600 nit , LTPO panel, 6,1"" to 6,2"" without growing the form factor)
Weight loss (168 to 162 grams)
Slightly better battery capacity (3900mAh to 4000 mAh)
Better design to me (flat phone bezel, matte finish)

The S23 was the perfect phone to me so these little improvements made me decide to bring in the S25 and sell my previous device (was not interested in S24 cause the Exynos chip). That way the next owner gets hardly 12 month of official Samsung warranty with my used S23 and if I remember correctly 3 years update of the software. Because of that, I get my stuff updated plus the next fella will be satisfied with my previous device = less e-waste. Sounds fair to me."
WOW. Don't even know how to clean a lens for a video. You clearly need glasses.
Apple biased Video..
"at 7:40, i believe you made a mistake, the iphone video it horrible, shaky, and unusable, but still you say the iphone is a little bit better. makes no sense. and in the next part, you say ""on the other hand, the iphone is better during the day"""
What wallpaper is he using in s25?
Got my S25 512 GB for 850$ :)
This is like comparing Messi and Ronaldo while both of the are the bestüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I would pick the S25 in regards to software and as a phone but if I cared about nothing else but battery life then I would pick the iPhone 16.
04:34 samsung looks more natural
No Telephoto No 120 Hz No AI  in 2025 makes iphone 16 still a bad decision but those who are supporting the iphone16 is just due to society pressure üòÇüòÇ
giving u upfront all features and give green / white / pink saber 2 years later~ go for samsung if u enthusiate color saber on ur screen
"ya choose wisely.. of cos apple... samsung green line issue is getting worse on its flasghip, bought Z flip 5, S23 not even 2 years of using, get green and white saber on the screen. And you have to pay for it like the green line and white line is consumer fault."
What's the use of 120 hz other than scrolling?
I wonder if the slowdowns on the iPhone is the new modem lagging?

"dude you conduct the stupidest tests of no use to the consumer. 

whats next  iphone 4 vs  Galaxy S26 ? You sound like a real dum*ass . and why are you always whispering?"
"What if there were no sanctions on Huawei, and the video showed a Huawei Mate Pro with a 3nm processor made by Huaweiüî•?"
Those 2 phones at the same price in Canada. There is no way to get an inferior phone over the other.
S25 is a no brainer choice this time around!
The difference with stability was just the Gemini app being the assistant app and therefore not going back to the icon

If iphone 16 had atleast 90hz I would have taken that
Both samsung galaxy and iphone look cheaper and less attractive compare to the last generation or their predecessor.
"Watching through my S25. I liked it but no more than my old Honor Magic 5. Honestly this year has been a let down for most of these big brands. Might as well get chinese phones, offers better for that price range."

As always apple never stops sucking the blood out of their customers. Samsung is not far behind but at least way behind than apple. BTW happy s23 customer hereüòÇ.
I thought S25 has the Anti reflective coating on screen. He never mentioned it. I think that is a deal breaker in selecting any smartphone.
Watching in S25üòó
In Samsung you have to turn on adaptive brightness to get the brightest displays in outdoors.
its high time for samsung to improve camera hardware  and battery tech among all the models with the s26 series which they wont do so
Support and Subscribe kardo guys üôèüèª  üëâüèª  #ayonsofficial
S25's screen replacement should cost more than 13k because recently I have made a screen replacement on my s21 fe which cost 13k
But still I'll choose I Phone 16
That 120 hz is just wow
60 hz kill the vibe üòÇ
You need only what Apple offers you and for that you have to pay them your fortune! Suckers!
"Record my words, the way samsung is developing its AI features, with next 7 years of update in S25 they will make one UI an Alian working for you
I hv s22 and it is way better than iphon 13 now in each aspect."
But seriously.....why don't they just update it to 120 maybe even 90
Samsung is Better to use ‚ù§
"People think they can't live without iMessage. People will buy apple no matter what. even if the S25 was 2x better in every way, 99% will still buy iPhone with trash specs."

Love the iphone always been super reliable especially for gaming. Always keeping the performance consistent üòä

"Did have a i phone 12, upgraded to the s24 ultra, wanted to try it in a shop with a case but couldn't, so took a chance, bought ultra direct from Samsung, but after 2 months of deliberating, decided it too big with case on, don't get me wrong it a great phone, but hard to use 1 handed also pretty heavy, (i like it as the object eraser is great) wish apple could do split screen, as that can be a game changer for a lot of people, yet I   may go back to the I phone,"

"Watching on my iPhone 16 pro desert titanium coming from iPhone 12 user.
Feels great with huge upgrades!"
"I challenge you to meet in same area where you took those photos (if you took them). And compare phones again, you bring them and I bring them. iPhone 16 PRO camera is the same camera that iPhone16 PRO MAX has. And S25 has camera from S22. Unless you S25 is very special the camera review is all wrong."
My Samsung has telephoto zoom on it already juat as the iphone. All it sounded like was you amping up iphone for no actual good reasons.
"Although iOS is being improved for customization, but it's still far behind from Android Customization and personal use. I prefer it, for other Specs in these high end devices were developped to the extent there are little differences on comparison. I would prefer S25 than 16 pro"
Please Compare S24 ultra VS s25+ pllus
I already regret change to samsung and want back my iPhone. User experience and ui interface is far better in iPhone üò¢
"If you're going for bang for buck, its hard to fault anything on the Xiaomi 14/15, if we're talking compact phones."
"Kinda obvious, samsung is a win without even watching the whole vid"
Samsung Galaxy S25 for me and my opinion ‚ù§
S25 way more realistic photos then iphone
I used the S23 before and I should‚Äôve upgraded to S25 instead of switching to iPhone 15 üò¢üò©
16pro it really 6.3? because that big big black island is about -0.5 inches
"To those saying that this is an unfair comparison, no it's not. GSMArena was also comparing Galaxy_S24 with iPhone 15 pro a year ago and it went on par with that. But unfortunately this year in the s25, you basically get the same camera sensors as the  S22 that's why it seems unfair. Blame Samsung for their ugly business practices"
"iPhone 16 pro has higher peak brightness sometimes, but I notice under directly sunlight that Galaxy S25 colours are not washout compared to iPhone 16 pro display.

Edited: Yes, there's a feature called vision booster in galaxy."

in terms of connectivity you should say that the iphone does have UWB for trascking devices and the base s25 does not. i really think thats a stupid decision from samsung.

Biased video.

Samsung should start providing Dolby vision in both phone and tv keeping the ego aside nonsense.
okay so im an iPhone user since last 6 years my first iphone was XR then i switched to 13 and now 15 but i kind of started hating on how basic it is :/ and like i agh

Apple won‚Äôt push the standard iPhones to 120 because that‚Äôs the main reason people buy the pros
They both suck at their price but the S25 is still much better
Samsung deu uma surra de pau mole na cara do iPhone.
It would affect the pro sales because there is the standard Pro version which has the same size screen as the base iPhone. That being said they should further innovate then and have a different selling point for the Pro's.

I personally think they say that bc they arenused to how people look on social media,  bc many of those videos are made with iphones, but when u compare it to a real camera u notice how weir the things look in the iphone; people are always orange üçä,  things have fixed colors for social media, and i just dont like that, thats why i thing the log video feature is a valuable addition.  Not saying samsung does it better,  but i definitely go for the s25 ultra as my next phone."

S25 her a√ßƒ±dan daha √ºst√ºn bir telefon ‚ù§
"How the iPhone 16 one is because the iPhone is at 60 Hz, it can be faster when it's lower frame rate you didn't even lower frame rate on the S25 üò¢ to 60hz"
pathetic from apple to still use 60hz screen in 2025
S25
The Samsung also on 60 Hz?
16
Wait for iPhone 17 it will destroy sumsung completely
IPhone best
Icy blue looks really blue in this Video. In other Videos it often appears to be almost white.
Useless comparison
That's not s25 bro
Pls do a Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Water test
I am surprised many of the pictures the S25 took looked absolutely terrible (especially close-ups. I think in most cases the problem was you were too close to what you were trying to photograph. The S25 has zero macro capabilities)
Eines kann das S25 echt gut: Brei!
Em pleno 2025 e o iPhone com autonomia de apenas 3500mAh ksksksksksksks
Nice

My 12 /512 poco x6 pro is better
Here because I‚Äôm tired of the fucking iPhone back shattering. Like why is the whole phone made of fucking glass? So retarded. I‚Äôm so pissed I just finished paying it off too. I‚Äôll be switching after being a loyal iPhone user my whole life I‚Äôm tired of the glass phone bullshit. Literally no reason or purpose other than to cash grab their customers with an overpriced apple care service.
s25 Wow!
I switched from S22U to iphone 15 Pro Max is insane.. i love iOS and never switch again. Waiting for iphone 18 or 19 Pro Max
"Samsung might have faster gpu when you force it to run at the top speed it can but for a regular user its exactly the same pretty much, so it depends on what phone you had already and what other devices, if you have all apple products then get iphone but if you have all samsung products then get samsung because for average users its down to familiarity"
"It's already known that the S25U is more powerful and resistant , and SD8 Elite is the highest end"
The quality on the iPhone is crazy!!üòÆ
I switched from samsung s24 + to iphone 15 pro. I thought the Samsung better and used to compete with people until trying real life experiment. The games on iphone are really smooth playable and iphone doesn't have any lags or issues.
#boycot usa trade war/%‚Ç¨& font buy apple mcdonalds tesla nike and everything els from usa
For me samsung üëë
Apple ü§°üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
"Used to be a samsung fan boy, but got tired to buy a new phone every years. I switched to apple and my Iphone is 4 years old and running like new. I wish Samsung did something, bit until that, i will stick to iphone"
Too bad benchmarks don‚Äôt mean anything to real world performance since most games are optimized for iPhone and perform better. Samsung needs to still better their optimizations with developers to realistically compete with apple.
S25 ultra is powerfulüóø
The S8 Elite is crazy
but put the s25 ultra on Normal HD display it last for 2days lol
Wait for 2 3 months updates...S25 U wl win by huge huge margin
"The iphone produced more frames in that 2 hour gaming benchmark resualting in higher battery consumption, further explaination üëá"
My phone literally stands for 13 hour
Wooooooow that is definitly gonna change my life
next time do the refrash to 60hz and not 120
It could have been more if you maintained same prightness nits in both the device.
I can't believe all the iPhone people fell into that money trap ecosystem so easy
"S25 ultra battery is big improvement, took forever to empty just 5% ,note: if you are heavy gamers use PD with just 25w charger you good to go ‚ù§"
Now test s25 ultra with a ip16+
"Buy a new branded iphone, techdroider says that iphones wins"
I promise ya my iPhone last longer than that s25 lol
Ladies first
Are the refresh rates the same?
Bro my a14 if it is kept for 17 days its 56 percent HOW
Not bad considering the s25 ultra is displaying 2x more pixels then the iphone
"I'm sure you have changed the
S24 with an Iphone charger..."
"Why the fk no one is talking about the battery life of iphone may be lower than 100%?
When she compared iphone 16 pro max with s24 ultra everyone cried that iphone came out later and have better battery life
Y'all are biased asfüòÇ"
2% for the clutch insane ! üò≠üëå This Samsung is impressive.

"iPhone 16 was great, the lighting is perfectly balanced"
"16 pro is just way better with superior exposure. Samsung is not caring about regular s series cameras, they terrible"
My mirrorless wins
Samsung looks way better
Gente qual o sentido da foto a noite ter ficado com a exposi√ß√£o alta na barraquinha? Nem meu J5 fica assim. Teve coisa a√≠ kkk
it would be a lot better if samaung s plus line up are using 100 mega pixel sensor instead of being stuck at 50 mega pixel since many midrange phone are now using 100 mega pixel nowadays.
"A do iphone ficou bem melhor, mas n faz sentido a compara√ß√£o ja q o S25+ estaria no nivel do iphone 16"
Definitely better Samsung ‚ù§‚ù§
iPhone
Both are insane and way better than temu phone(xiaomiü§°üá®üá≥üìâ)
S25 plus is sooo much better
Nice üòä
"Awesome video, I'd have gone with the Galaxy just for the multitasking."
Definitely iPhone
Samsung genuinely feels cheap in the hand
"As much as i love Samsung & oneui7 and yes, if i were buying one of these it would be the s25+. Yet the iPhone 16pro is the better phone hands down."
"Good review, and with a lot of sense. Although I am not a big fan of Apple, it must be said that the iPhone is a better balanced phone, and the cameras are its great differentiator. 

It would be interesting to compare the iPhone with high-end models with good cameras, like the Vivo X200 Pro (or Mini)."
Great content and video comprision keep it up as always let me decided which one I would going to buy it bro
Great quality videos. Keep it up!
