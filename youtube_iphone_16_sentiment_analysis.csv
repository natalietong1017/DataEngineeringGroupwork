"There was a period of time where I had Pro models of iPhone, iPad and MacBook all with ProMotion.

100% saw the difference compared to 60Hz devices and was loud about it, showing it to others and making a point of how 60Hz wasn't good enough. No one else cared (or cared enough, at least). It was just a mild interest to most people, and certainly didn't spoil their 60Hz device for them.

Over the years, I've walked back down the product line to a MacBook Air I chose for thinness, and an iPhone 16 I chose because I didn't need all the stuff on my last Pro iPhone. Maybe takes a short while to get used to again, but it's not life changing. I don't spend loads of time missing it or wishing it was on the lower end products, and I get why Apple sees it as a fit compromise. I'm sure they've done the market research to know that the average non-technical non-Pro customer does not see it as necessary.

I'm never gonna be one who actively asks for less, because getting more for your money is always better. And if Apple put ProMotion screens in the standard non-Pro products I'd definitely be happy. But I can definitely see why Apple chooses to draw the line with ProMotion as a Pro model feature.",0.9785,0.141,0.029,0.83

"The difficulty in switching is up to the individual who is switching. Depending on how deep into apple's ecosystem you are the harder it is. If you own everything apple, apple watch, airpod, ipad, some crappy apple laptop/desktop then yeah switching to android is going to be a nightmare for you. And thats by design of apple. They want to hook their claws in, sink their teeth into you so you cant get out. Apple products do not play well with anything non-apple. And because apple is seen as a luxury brand and that extremely wrong catch phrase ""it just works"" (no it doesn't) most people think its the non-apple device that is having problems. And thats also again from apple with their marketing making it seem like android or windows are these devices that have tons of problems even though all of them are roughly similar in stability.

So wondering why the apple watch aren't as good when paired to a non-apple product? Or wondering why on android trrying to use that phone with your apple computer only for it to be frustrating as hell? Thats apple's fault. They don't wan to play nice. In doing so they hope your ignorant enough to go oh its the non-apple product that is the problem. And then either switch to apple or switch back to apple. 

Then theres the amount of stuff that just doesn't get transferred over when switching from apple to android. The ios specific apps that aren't on android either cause they are apple's products or made deals with devs to not bring them over. These are all breaking points meant to get users to stay with apple, or regret their purchase and go back to apple. 

However, if you are willing to have an windows pc, a samsung device with all the other samsung stuff, your experience will be 99% similar in use with apple. Most if not all the stuff you can do in the apple ecosystem is prevalent on android with windows pcs. Theres alternative apps and programs that perform at the same level or better depending on your pc and phone. You get a lot more freedom of choice for what you wan it to be. But again this requires you to abandon apple almost if not entirely. Trying to get apple to play nice with non-apple device is an exercise in frustration and futility.",-0.9065,0.046,0.084,0.869

"There are no refurbished iPhone 15 Pros in the UK on the Apple Store, so that is off the agenda. The nearest, the 14 Pro, is £740, so I would guess if they were in stock, they would be around £850, which is not competing on price with the 16E- instead, it is an alternative to the iPhone 16.

I would not recommend that anyone buy secondhand as you are at risk. There may be a good reason people sell their year-old iPhones, and at the average eBay price of £690 for the 15 Pro, that is chancy. 

If you buy new and want the entry point iPhone, that is the 16E. Negatives aside, as you can pay more if you need a specific feature(s), that is what you face. Androids punch with better bangs for bucks, but Android is not on your radar if you only want an iPhone. So, for businesses, my elderly parents, and iPhone devotees, this is what they will get. Paying £200 extra for features they have no interest in won't be sensible for them or millions of others.

"Samsung is a big name in the world of electronics. Samsung mobiles are the best selling. Galaxy S Ultra series is very famous.

 

This year S25 Ultra was launched. I bought it on 5th February 2025. The phone started malfunctioning from the very first day.

 

I went to the local Samsung service center, they postponed the matter. I went there again and again, finally they did a reset and software update.

 

Meanwhile, Samsung's customer care also worked on the phone.

 

For the last one month, I either wait for the phone or go to the service center and sit there.

 

Every time they just postpone it, they will do something tomorrow, they will do it after three days, Samsung has given me nothing but stress for the last one month.

 

I am 68 years old, I am a heart patient, I have kidney problems, I have blood pressure, I am diabetic, I take medicines throughout the day. My doctor advises me to avoid stress.

 

But for the last one month Samsung has brought a lot of stress on me.

 

My cardiologist is worried about my health. If tomorrow there is any effect on my life then Samsung will definitely be responsible.

 

I request with folded hands, never buy anything from Samsung. Once they sell it, these people do not listen to anyone, at any cost.

 

On Monday I will present my case in the consumer court. From tomorrow itself I will make posters in the city and warn customers through microphone - do not buy Samsung. Even Galaxy S25 Ultra turned out to be bad and no one is listening to me.

"Thanks for the thorough review as most other reviewers seem to have whined about it being a minor update from the S24 rather than showing what the phone is capable of. Moving from a 4 year old iPhone 12 it's been a major upgrade for me - screen, battery life, camera and overall snappiness have been worth it for me and I got a great deal through my employer with Samsung directly. Only downside is I maybe wish I'd got the 25+ as it is does feel even smaller than the iPhone 12 I moved from (or my fingers have gotten fatter). Only things I miss really are AirTag support and FaceID  (using the temperamental finger print scanner is a massive downgrade I wasn't expecting). Yes I know Samsung have their alternatives but they are ropey/insecure compared to Apple. Not a deal breaker for me though",0.6911,0.075,0.038,0.886

"Surprisingly enough at least here in the United States. There's about 50 million people. Maybe more that don't really replace their smartphones unless either a. They have no good battery life and they pretty much have to keep it plugged into a charger or b. It stops doing its software updates And becomes all glitchy that is when they then go and replace their phone. So there is a lot of people who do that. In fact, it used to be super popular amongst iPhone users to jailbreak your phones to get extra versions of iOS updates and security patches past what Apple was going to give you from the factory to make your phone continue to work even longer especially amongst the iPhone users that still had 32 pen charging port iPhones cuz when the lightning port came out it charged the phone fast enough that Apple started sacrificing battery life and had barely noticeable improvement in performance side note, I do also remember a company at one point that was making phone cases that had built-in batteries. So that way they could act as battery extensions to help you get more run time out of your cell phone for the day. Cuz there was a lot of Android smartphones at that time that if you wanted performance you didn't have a good all-day battery life The Advent of better car chargers than 5 w like 7 and 1/2 watt car chargers and even just 6 w car chargers at the time as well as the ability to easily carry a charging brick around and many public places like malls. Having power outlets that you could use already for charging your laptop and then companies releasing high-speed 10 w wall chargers as well to use to charge your phones that did not regulate their charging. So if you plugged a 10 watt charger into the phone it would get very hot and charge very quickly I remember one of my old phones with a 1500 milliamp battery going from being completely dead. Having died to being fully charged in about 45 minutes using a 2 amp wall charger because some of the early phones didn't have any power regulation and would just Chuck whatever they could into the battery.",0.9569,0.095,0.045,0.86

"Ex hardcore samsung phone user here. Not anymore. Changed to FindX8. Guess I got lucky since this time chinese phone doesn't let me down. Buying samsung at this point of time is like asking yourself to be scammed. Only great things about samsung is that they are king of customization. You can customize everything. Including recent apps menu, back, home stuff. They also got knox and samsung pay. 

Well that's what I can think of samsung as a long time user. But the downside is crazy. Switching from s23 to Findx8 makes you realise that samsung really is choppy actually. They got a lot of stutter. Maybe it's not fair to say that since it's 2-3 years difference of chip but the latest samsung doesn't improve either way. Also their battery life sucks so much. Switching because the green line being the breaking point. Make me realise that samsung is bad. X8 is crazy good. Performance, snappiness, the camera, battery life. Just crazy. People maybe not realise but samsung is really, laggy actually. People just turn a blind eye to it. When you restart the samsung, and unlocked it, the system is so slow. people would be like ""Just give it sometime, It needs to load up first"" or something. Not my X8 though. Right after restart, I can continue using it like it never restart in the first place. Not only that, X8 copy the good thing of apple like the smoothness and animation.",-0.8127,0.089,0.115,0.796
"Have been very happy using my S22 for the past almost 3 years but unfortunately due to a bad fall with no case, the screen started to fail after getting a black dot and now is flickering so much. I was wondering whether replace the screen and keeping the phone for 2 more years or enjoy the Samsung trade-in program plus some discounts to get the S25.

I love the size and how it feels in the hand. Photos have been great too and exepecting with the latest Snapdragon to get a better battery life compared to my S22, and that's a strong point too.

Great video with the all the needed details.

"Nice video! I just upgraded my S21 5G to the S25+ (both 256gb). The size is not that noticeable, but I wanted a slightly larger screen, but not as large as the Ultra (and I don’t get the pen thing). I paid $649 from Consumer Cellular for 2 years interest free at $26 per month, with no trade-in. I have to pay it off if I leave their service, but their US based customer service is so outstanding, I’ll never leave. They’ll spend 45 minutes with you, and you can understand them. Need a credit? Just ask. 

At 4 years apart, they are similar. If using it for a phone mainly or reading news or YouTube (okay, I play slots sometimes), you may never see a difference as the S21 has 8gb of RAM, which isn’t shabby even today. I won’t max out the 12gb capacity of the S25+, so while I’m glad to have it, it isn’t that necessary. I’m not a gamer, so I can’t comment on that. I’d use a PC or TV if I were gaming. I’m not a photographer, so the differences in cameras aren’t that noticeable either. Most photos are deleted over time anyway, so cameras are as good as they probably need to be, except maybe for professionals, who would probably use a real camera. I mean, how good does a phone camera really need to be?

I’d say the S25 is too small for today’s phones and with the effort it takes to change phones, unless you just want a small phone, I’d recommend the S25+ for the .5” larger screen for $100 more, although the phone isn’t .5” larger. The S21 didn’t seem small when I got it, but over time it seemed to shrink, or my eyes just wanted things a little larger. I also wanted the latest processor because this is the 1st new phone I’ve bought in over a decade (I’ve bought used, refurbished). 

Unless you just want a tiny phone, if you hold the S25 and then the S25+, when you again hold the S25, you’ll definitely know you want the larger + model, which is only slight, but makes a difference. The good thing is, no matter which model you get, they are basically the same inside. If I had an S24, I would not have upgraded, even though it's smaller (same size as the other opening models). The performance would not be noticed and it would not be logical to upgrade unless it was nearly free. The S21 5G phone is so good I'd recommend it refurbished, or even from my eBay listing for it. It is a great phone and if it were an S21+, I wouldn't have upgraded to the S25+. The fancy bubbles and AI it offers isn't enough to have changed, but I am completely satisfied with it and will use it for many years after it is paid for.",0.9973,0.142,0.012,0.846
